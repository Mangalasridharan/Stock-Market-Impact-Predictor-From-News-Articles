         "ADM",
         "Amid the ongoing trade tensions between the Unites States and China, the U.S. stock market continues to enjoy the longest bull run since World War II by avoiding 20% or more decline. The large-cap S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite Index, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index and the mid-cap S&P 400 Mid Cap Index all touched new highs in Monday's trading session and the Dow Jones reclaimed its 26,000 mark, reflecting a broad-based rally.\nStrong rebound in large-capitalization technology and Internet stocks as well as strong corporate earnings led to investors' appetite for more risk in recent weeks. Double-digit earnings growth in the second quarter is expected to be the highest quarterly growth pace in almost eight years. For full-year 2018, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index are expected to be up 20.6% on 6.3% higher revenues.\nAdditionally, the trade agreement reached between the United States and Mexico boosted investor sentiment. Further, the U.S. economy is witnessing the fastest pace of growth in nearly four years with a nearly two-decade low unemployment rate of 3.9%, thanks to historic tax cuts, higher government spending, deregulation, rising consumer confidence and higher spending. Per Trump, \"the United States is on track to hit the highest annual growth rate in over 13 years.\"\nWhile there are winners in every corner of the space, growth investing takes center stage and is easily outperforming its value brethren this month. This is especially true given that the S&P 500 Growth Index is up 3.9% so far this month compared with gain of 1.6% for the S&P 500 Value Index.\nWhy Growth?\nGrowth investing is basically a momentum play and a great strategy in a trending market (a market characterized by a prolonged uptrend). Growth stocks refer to high-quality stocks that are likely to witness revenues and earnings increase at a faster rate than the industry average. These stocks harness their momentum in earnings to create a positive bias in the market, resulting in higher share prices.\nAs such, growth stocks tend to outperform during an uptrend but exhibit a higher degree of volatility especially compared to value stocks.\nHow to Tap?\nGiven this, many investors may want to tap the current bullish market fundamentals. For them, we have highlighted five stocks that hit all-time highs in the current market rally and will likely to continue to move higher given their superior fundamentals.\nWith the help of our Zacks Stock Screener , we have screened through several criteria like a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), a Growth Score of A, positive earnings estimate revision for this year, double-digit estimated earnings growth for this year, and a solid Zacks industry Rank.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

         "3 Strong Buy Semiconductor Stocks to Consider Now",
         "AMAT",
         "Semiconductor stocks were battered by the recent market sell-off, but tech has made a strong recovery, and with several interesting trends like the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence on the rise, it is still an exciting time to be investing in chip-making corner of the technology sector.\nWhile tech behemoths like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL may hog all the headlines, it has really been the companies powering their technologies-the semiconductor manufacturers-that have been garnering the attention of Wall Street.\nIndeed, as our \" Computer and Technology \" sector has gained nearly 20.9% over the past year, semiconductor companies have been a driving factor behind its growth. The aforementioned emerging tech trends have created new consumer demand, and the semiconductor makers are delivering.\nLuckily, the proven Zacks stock picking methods are effective across all industries. Check out these Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) semiconductor stocks right now:\n1. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT)\nApplied Materials is one of the world's largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD, and solar PV cell manufacturers. When the semiconductor business is booming, Applied benefits as its clients demand new equipment and services.\nIn its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year. It is not often that companies with AMAT's size and legacy see such rapid expansion-and this growth is a testament to the strength of its client base.\nOn top of its #1 (Strong Buy) designation, AMAT is also presenting some interesting valuation metrics. The stock is trading at just over 12x forward earnings, and with its PEG ratio of 0.9 investors can see that they are getting a decent price for its earnings growth potential.\n2. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)\nMicron is one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions. The company's products are marketed towards customers in a variety of industries, including computer manufacturing, consumer electronics, and telecommunications. Micron's rapid top and bottom line growth has made short-term price swings a common occurrence, but the firm has the potential to dominate for years.\nMicron is expected to continue its streak of impressive growth, with current consensus estimates calling for earnings to improve an additional 122% on the back of 44% revenue growth this fiscal year. But the stock is also sporting an \"A\" grade for Value in our Style Scores system and it looking like one of the tech sector's top value options.\nMU is trading with a Forward P/E of just 4.6, and its rock-bottom PEG of 0.5 implies that investors are getting a great price for its aforementioned growth. Meanwhile, its P/S of 2.3 is respectable, while its P/B of 2.2 is well within the ideal range.\n3. Mellanox Technologies, Inc. (MLNX)\nMellanox Technologies is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs. The company's VPI enables standard communication protocols to operate over any converged network with the same software solution.\nMellanox is scheduled to release its latest quarterly report next week, and our consensus estimates are calling for the company to post EPS growth of 183% and revenue growth of 29%. Management has also managed to beat earnings estimates in three-consecutive quarters. Heading into the report, MLNZ is trading at 19.9x forward earnings-its lowest earnings multiple in over a year.\nWant more market analysis from this author?

         "ANIP",
         "Pfizer PFE announced disappointing overall survival (OS) results from the phase III PALOMA-3 study. The study showed that the combination of Ibranceand AstraZeneca's AZN Faslodex (fulvestrant) failed to improve OS compared with Faslodex and placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior endocrine therapy. The study is being conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Ibranceplus Faslodex in women with endocrine therapy-resistant metastatic breast cancer.\nOS was a secondary endpoint for the PALOMA-3 trial. The company stated that, as a secondary endpoint, the study was not \"optimized\" to detect a statistically significant difference in OS.\nThe primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) was previously reported and led to the FDA approval for Ibrance plus Faslodex for pretreated women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. In findings published in The Lancet Oncology, the median PFS was 9.5 months with Ibrance and Faslodex compared with 4.6 months for Faslodex alone.\nThe most common adverse reactions in PALOMA-3 included neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue and nausea; No new safety signals were identified as part of this final OS analysis.\nYear to date, shares of Pfizer have increased 0.4% against the industry 's decline of 4.9%.\nWe remind investors that Ibrance had received accelerated approval from the FDA in February 2015. to be used in combination with Novartis' NVS Femara (letrozole) for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer as an initial endocrine-based therapy for their metastatic disease.Pfizer is working on expanding Ibrance's label further by targeting different segments of breast cancer patients. The company will present the detailed data at an upcoming medical meeting.\nPfizer Inc. Price\nPfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc.

         "Microsoft to Launch Second-Gen Hololens AR Headset in Early 2019 (Report)",
         "AR",
         "Microsoft is getting ready to launch the next version of its Hololensaugmented reality ( AR ) headset in early 2019, according to Engadget . The tech blog reported Friday that Microsoft is using Qualcomm's new XR 1 chip to power the device. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment.\nMicrosoft released the first version of Hololens in early 2016. With an introductory price tag of $3000, the headset has primarily been embraced by enterprise clients looking to use AR in manufacturing as well as developers trying to get a head-start on AR.\nMicrosoft has since expanded its work in immersive technologies with the launch of Windows Mixed Reality, which powers virtual reality ( VR ) devices like the Samsung Odyssey headset.\nThe current-generation Hololens device is being powered by an Intel chipset.

         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n[Editor's note: This story has been updated from a previously published version.]\nNow isn't the time to panic. Now is the time to sort the strong buy stocks from the crowd. It's time to be active but selective when choosing the best stocks to invest in for the long haul.\nWith the market so choppy right now all ten of these stocks are trading at extremely compelling levels. The selloff has unlocked value and created some great buying opportunities. Some of these stocks have reported mixed earnings results, but the bullish long-term picture is nonetheless firmly intact. Indeed, as you will see below analysts are also calling these specific stocks cheap right now.\nHere I use TipRanks market data to be a bit more precise.\n15 Winning Stocks to Buy in 2019 (That Were Losers in 2018)\nIn other words, I can see the exact upside potential analysts are modelling for from current share price levels. That gives us a much clearer idea of the kind of growth outlook we can expect. Are you ready? Some of these stocks are poised for serious growth …\nApple (AAPL)\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares plunged last month after the tech giant's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. This was despite Apple beating out the Street's predictions by 20% with revenue of $62.9 billion and EPS of $2.91.\nSo what spooked investors? AAPL's guidance of $91 billion for the holiday season fell short of expectations. Meanwhile, Apple announced it will no longer release unit sales figures for iPhones, iPads and Macs. One analyst called this a \"jaw-dropper,\" as \"Apple is at the critical juncture where higher ASPs [average selling prices] are making up for slower unit sales, which remains the worry.\"\nTwo subsequent rating downgrades caused a further blow to share prices.\nHowever, top-ranked Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives ( Track Record & Ratings ) is bullish. He has reiterated his \"buy\" rating with a Street-high price target of $275 (down from $310). From current levels, this indicates lucrative upside potential of over 65%.\nIves said previously that \"our core bull thesis does not change on the story and to some extent is emboldened by the ~$800 ASP story and a robust services business poised to hit $50 billion+ in FY20.\" In his latest revision nine days ago, here's what Ives had to say about Apple stock's latest bouts with market volatility:\n\"It continues to feel like every day the sun will come out and there will be another bad data point for Apple as since the company reported its quarter in early November it's been a string of bad news around iPhone demand, transparency in the food chain, supplier cuts, China tariff worries with the stock down significantly and losing its gains for the year.\"\nYet, Ives still believes in the long-term bull case surrounding Apple stock. Ives points to Apple Services as a game-changer for the stock. Apple now has an active installed base of 1.3 billion devices to monetize.\n\"We caution investors not to lose sight of the massive metamorphosis on the horizon at Apple being led by the services business,\" Ives wrote. \"We continue to encourage investors to see the forest through the trees on this name and view last week as the first step in the ultimate re-rating of the stock higher over the coming years.\" Interested in AAPL stock?

Pet biotech stock Kindred Biosciences Inc (NASDAQ: KIN ) has just released positive pilot data for the company's first antibody product, KIND-016, for atopic dermatitis in dogs.\nFor Folkes the data \"validates KIN's ability to develop a portfolio of companion animal antibody products that target large market opportunities with differentiated or superior products.\"\nHe raised his price target from $20 to $25 as \"KIN has multiple antibody product candidates in development that could represent $100MM+ opportunities each.\" The stock is currently at just $11.11. [Ed's note: Down $3 since this article's previous update.]\nPlus a word of reassurance about a crowded market: the market has sufficient capacity to support multiple blockbuster products, including KIND-016.\n10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains\nBottom line: \"We believe KIN's pipeline of novel animal health drugs will drive long-term shareholder value, and we expect upward earnings revisions, multiple expansion, and pipeline advancements to drive the stock higher.\" Get the KIN Stock Research Report.\nSource: Shutterstock\nAlibaba (BABA)\nIt's worth taking a look at the bigger picture when it comes to Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stock. And analysts are unanimously optimistic on China's e-commerce giant - especially when it comes to the long-term.\nOkay, so the company reported mixed Q2 results. Alibaba's Q2 ESP of 9.60 yuan ($1.40) came in well above the 7.43 yuan expected by the Street. But BABA also cut its full-year sales forecast by 4-6% due to concerns over the economic impact of a U.S.-China trade spat.\nThese macro issues have brought shares down 16% year-over-year. However, this just makes the upside opportunity even stronger. On average top, analysts are modelling for 50% upside potential.\nRBC Capital's Mark Mahaney ( Track Record & Ratings ) wrote: \"If the Macros do not worsen further (yes, a big IF), we view BABA's Risk/Reward as very compelling here. Why? Core China Commerce Comps likely ease through the second half of the year and into next.\"\nHe calls strategic investments in Ele.me, Lazada, New Retail and Cainiao \"the right ones\" while BABA's consistent, robust growth rates are indicative of the platform's strength and scale. Finally, Cloud continues to demonstrate hyper-growth (+90% Y/Y). Get the BABA Stock Research Report.\nSource: Josh Hallett via Flickr (Modified)\nAlcoa (AA)\nAluminum stock Alcoa Corp (NYSE: AA ) is just too cheap to ignore, says Credit Suisse's Curt Woodworth ( Track Record & Ratings ). He made the call on the back of stellar Q3 results. Encouragingly, AA also announced a $200M buyback program.\nThis is a stock that is now 'significantly undervalued' writes Woodworth. He sees Q3's strong operating performance and tightness in alumina supply sparking meaningful earnings revisions across the Street.\nEven more bullish is JP Morgan's Michael Gambardella. Following the Q3 results, he bumped his price target up to $79 from $75 previously. That means he now sees shares exploding 116%! Gambardella's take is that right now shares are \"discounting too steep of a drop in alumina and aluminum prices.\"\n5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider\nLike Alibaba, Alcoa scores a full house of Buy ratings from the Street. Meanwhile, the average analyst price target of $60 suggests upside potential of over 65%. Get the AA Stock Research Report.\nSource: Shutterstock\nConstellation Brands (STZ)\nDrinks giant Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ ) has just reported a 'beautiful quarter.' Powerful growth resulted in EPS soaring 15.6% from Q2 with sales up over 10%.\n\"The core business is growing faster than anyone believed, and the Canopy Growth investment is very likely a masterstroke,\" gushes Pivotal Research's Timothy Ramey ( Track Record & Ratings ).\nThe company has just announced a massive $4 billion investment in Canada's Canopy Growth for a 38% stake (up from 9.9% previously) - our \"exclusive global cannabis partner,\" according to Constellation Brands CEO Rob Sands.\n\"We are convinced that CGC is the best way to play the rapidly growing Cannabis market and investors should begin to fully reflect that value and CGC's prospects, rather than penalizing STZ for the cash carrying costs of the investment\" argues Ramey.\nPlus, Constellation trades at 22x our estimate of FY20 EPS and 17.3x FY18 EV/EBITDA - no doubt as cheap as STZ has been in the past five years. If we look at Ramey's $300 price target, this suggests 70%-plus upside from current levels! Full steam ahead I say. Get the STZ Stock Research Report.\nStocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)\nSource: Amazon\nContrary to Street expectations, mega stock Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) failed to impress with its recent 3Q18 revenue results. Meanwhile, AMZN guided for Q4 operating margin of $2.10-$3.60B (4.1% margin at the midpoint). This was below the Street's $3.86B forecast (5.2% margin).\nBut don't be put off. Instead, consider this an early holiday discount. Stifel Nicolaus' Scott Devitt ( Track Record & Ratings ) stuck to his Buy rating post-earnings with a $2,400 price target. From current levels, this indicates 44% upside potential.\n\"Weaker than expected guidance may caution some, though we note results remain strong on an absolute basis and maintain our positive view given Amazon's leading position in the Cloud services and retail sectors and the growing margin opportunity as the revenue mix shifts towards the higher margin AWS and advertising businesses\" states the Stifel analyst.\nPlus from a longer-term perspective, AMZN still stands out from the crowd. \"Amazon, in our view, remains one of the best longer-term values in Tech and we still see a path to where the shares could double over the next three years,\" says Aegis' Victor Anthony.\n5 Top Stocks to Make the Most of a Divided Congress\nThese analysts enjoy a clear majority when it comes to AMZN stock. With 36 recent buy ratings, only one analyst (KeyBanc's Edward Yruma) is still on the sidelines. Get the AMZN Stock Research Report.\nSource: Shutterstock\nVertex Pharma (VRTX)\nHC Wainwright's Andrew Fein ( Track Record & Ratings ) has been forced to reanalyze his take on biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRTX ). And if this isn't a stock on your Buy list, I suggest you reanalyze too!\n\"We have recently returned from the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference, and in conversations with physicians, nurses and CF care-givers we were astounded by the positive reaction the cystic fibrosis community has towards the Vertex triples\" Fein writes.\nAs a result, he upgraded the stock from \"hold\" to \"buy.\" The analyst continues: \"We have not seen this level of optimism and heard so many anecdotal experiences since the early days of Kalydeco in G551D patients.\"\nWith this heightened likelihood of success in mind, Fein takes the stock to a bullish $220 price target (27% upside potential). Taken together, these triple regimen assumptions yield POS [probability of success] adjusted worldwide revenues of $529M in 2020 - and get this - could grow to $7.3B by 2024.\nOverall this strong buy stock scores 10 recent buy ratings versus just one hold rating. Get the VRTX Stock Research Report.\nSource: Shutterstock\nCapital One Financial (COF)\nCapital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF ) is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, auto loans, banking and savings products. \"We see favorable credit, modest loan growth, and thoughtful expense management to support our positive fundamental outlook - shares meanwhile are very modestly valued at 7.8x 2019E,\" opines RBC Capital's Jason Arnold ( Track Record & Ratings ).\nHe made the comments following a resounding Q3 earnings beat. COF reported GAAP EPS of $2.99 vs. the firm's $2.77 estimate. Encouragingly, improved credit performance and favorable outlook suggest \"growth math\" continues, and that credit losses should remain more stable. Arnold now has a $123 price target up from $121 previously, which means he sees 41% upside potential.\n7 Safe Haven Stocks for a Treacherous Market\nIn total, COF has received 8 recent Buy ratings with 1 Hold rating. Get the COF Stock Research Report.\nNewell Brands (NWL)\nIf you are looking for a bit of a leap of faith, then this could be the stock for you. Newell Brands Inc (NYSE: NWL ) is a worldwide marketer of consumer and commercial products with a portfolio of brands including Rubbermaid food storage, home organization and reusable container products.\nNow to the facts: Newell Brands is down -25% over the last month vs. the S&P 500 which is down -6%. Plus the stock's analyst consensus is Hold. So that's not great. But one top analyst believes that we are looking at a strong buying opportunity, and her points hold sway:\n\"We think the recent sharp selloff in NWL shares is way overdone and would be aggressive buyers at these levels\" writes Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog ( Track Record & Ratings ). She sees shares soaring a whopping 80% to $36.\nHerzog believes the underperformance is down to a large shareholder unwinding their position (which could be close to being finished) as well as several concerns including: no news on asset sales, high leverage and exposure to China.\n\"We've talked to many investors over the past few weeks and while there is a lot of interest in the stock, few investors are willing to buy the weakness, with many suggesting they believe in the long-term opportunity but would rather wait and buy the stock on an up-swing.\"\nNet-net, that presents a great buy opportunity - with significant upside to shares even in Herzog's worst-case scenario. Get the NWL Stock Research Report.\nSource: Shutterstock\nMarvell (MRVL)\nThis semiconductor stock has just held an upbeat analyst day - sparking 13 Buy ratings from the Street. This includes an all-important upgrade from BMO's Ambrish Srivastava ( Track Record & Ratings ). Here's why he is moving to the bull camp on Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL ).\n\"We have stayed on the sidelines long enough. We like the valuation, we find the risk/reward attractive ($6 upside/$2 downside), find estimates reasonable, especially after Marvell cleared the deck on the Cavium estimates, and management has built a track record of executing,\" cheered Srivastava. He thus raised his rating on shares to Outperform with a $24 target price (36% upside from current levels).\n7 Ways Starbucks Stock Wins in 2019 and Beyond\nAt the analyst event, management singled out 5G as MRVL's largest growth/upside driver going forward, while announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization (up from $300M previously).

         "After registering record declines on Oct 10, all the three key U.S. indexes witnessed further losses on Oct 11. Higher interest rates, increasing bond yields and renewed fears of a trade war may find investors scurrying toward safe-haven sectors that have already emerged as preferred investments.\nOne of the most-popular, safe-haven sectors is utilities. This sector comprises companies that provide telephone, gas, water and electricity services. In this context, equity-focused investors looking for stable dividend and interest income can invest in utilities.\nIndexes Are In Choppy Ground\nThe Dow 30 declined by about 1,400 points in the last two trading days. The Nasdaq not only entered correction territory during the day, but also closed the day 9.6% lower than its Aug 29 record. Moreover, the S&P 500 ended in the red for the sixth straight trading day. The broader index finished lower than its 200-day moving average, its first time since April.\nMarkets are on volatile ground, as evident from the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which increased 2 points to 24.98 on Oct 11, the highest settlement since Feb 15. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates a bearish outlook in the equity market.\nRising Rates Spook Investors\nA sudden increase in long-term bond yields weigh on the equity market as a rapid increase in bond yields in turn will boost borrowing costs. Earlier, this week, yields on the 10-year Treasury note was at 3.26%, its highest since April 2011. Although, on Oct 11, the 10-year Treasury note decreased by 6 points to 3.158%, it was higher than last month's 2.979%.\nAdditionally, the Fed has already raised its federal funds rate for the third time this year. The Fed's aggressive rate hike approach invited criticism from President Trump, with the President saying that \"the Fed is making a mistake.\" A high interest rate environment along with continued trade war tensions between the United States and China weighed on investor sentiment and resulted in this two-day carnage.\nWhy Buy Utilities Stocks?\nAmong the safe-haven sectors, utilities could be good investments as these generate solid income for their investors. Traditionally, this segment offers protection against a downward trending market, or when there is world strife that will impact the economy globally.\nInvestors with a conservative mindset looking for stable current income would do well to consider utilities. They are used as defensive instruments, which protect investments during a market downturn. This is because demand for essential services such as those provided by utilities remains unchanged even during difficult times.\nMoreover, most of the utilities maintain a high level of monopoly across their geographic markets. This in turn helps these companies to retain their profitability and continued existence. Constant demand for utilities-related services ensures long-term sustainability for these stocks.\nBuy These 5 Utility Stocks\nRising bond yields, increasing interest rates and trade war fears make utility stocks a good investment. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) has advanced 0.4% in the last five trading days, becoming the only S&P 500 sector to end in the green over this period.\nWe have selected five stocks that are expected to emerge relatively unscathed from the bloodbath.

         "Here's Why You Should Grab AGNC Investment (AGNC) Stock Now",
         "AGNC",
         "AGNC Investment Corp.AGNC is making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio, in order to offset the risks related to interest rates and prepayment uncertainty. Further, the company's efficient cost structure augurs well.\nSpecifically, this residential mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) remains focused to increase investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) and improve its hedge portfolio. The company adheres to an active portfolio-management policy, which includes re-evaluation and adjustment of its portfolio, as well as hedges amid varying interest rate and mortgage market environment.\nNotably, during the April-June quarter, AGNC Investment increased its hedge portfolio to $68.4 billion, while overall hedge ratio was 99% of the funding liabilities. Also, during the same time period, it increased investment portfolio to $77 billion, with MBS portfolio increasing nearly $8 million.\nImportantly, MBS spreads in the second quarter remained materially unchanged sequentially. In addition, amid favorable outlook for returns on Agency MBS, as well as the prevailing interest rate scenario, the company's efforts to gradually increase its MBS investments are a strategic fit.\nAlso, its efforts to reduce duration gap will support AGNC Investment performance over the long run. Large scale of operations and portfolio diversification have enabled the company to enjoy a substantially low expense level. In fact, its operating expense as a percentage of stockholders' equity is 0.80%\nAGNC Investment also enjoys decent financial muscle. It has solid access to attractive funding across a broad spectrum of counterparties and financing conditions. This provides the company flexibility in the opportunistic enhancement of its portfolio. Additionally, at the end of the second quarter, it raised nearly $800 million in new capital. Following this, the company issued 43.7 million shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of $825.9 million in August.\nFurthermore, the company's low leverage, as compared to the industry, makes it a safe bet. It has a debt/equity ratio of 0.04, lower than the industry's average of 1.68. As such, it enjoys high financial flexibility, which supports the company's growth pursuits.\nIts return on equity is 11.7% compared with the industry's average of 9.8%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.\nAGNC Investment also generates higher cash flow per share of $3.32 compared to the industry's average of $1.86.\nShares of AGNC Investment have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. During this period, shares of the company have edged down 0.3% as compared with the industry's increase of 1.2%. Nonetheless, given the company's progress on fundamentals, the stock presents an attractive buying opportunity for investors.\nLastly, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a solid outlook for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

         "Archer Daniels reports Q4 numbers February 6",
         "ADM",
         "What's Happening\nArcher Daniels ( ADM ) will report Q4 results February 6. Look for the report before the market opens, with the consensus calling for earnings of $0.69 per share. During the same period last year the company earned $0.75, and the stock has risen 4.8% on the year.\nTechnical Analysis\nADM was recently trading at $42.02, down $5.42 from its 12-month high and $3.43 above its 12-month low. Overall technical indicators for ADM are bearish with a possible trend reversal. The stock has recent support above $40.25, and recent resistance below $43.75. Of the 12 analysts who cover the stock, two rate it a \"strong buy\", eight rate it a \"hold\", and two rates it a \"strong sell\". ADM gets a score of 27 from InvestorsObserver's Stock Score Report.\nAnalyst's Thoughts\nArcher Daniels has struggled to grow earnings in recent years. Over the last five years, the company's profits have fallen, on average by 0.75%, and that is expected to worsen moving forward, with analysts forecasting earnings will fall by 10.4% per annum over the next five years. The good news is that the earnings drop has already been priced into the stock, so the downside is limited as long as the company is able to hit its estimates, and there is a lot of upside potential on any better than expected quarterly numbers. Last quarter the company missed on the top and bottom line, and the stock took a big hit. It has since recovered, but will need a strong set of numbers in order to build on its recent gains. Long positions should be watched closely, and investors should have a clear exit strategy in place just in case there is another negative earnings surprise.\nStock Only Trade\nI would not look to buy a long position in the stock ahead of the upcoming report, and would prefer instead to wait for the results and make a move after the report if the numbers are better than analysts forecast.\nBullish Trade\nIf you want a bullish hedged trade on the stock, consider a March 33/38 bull-put credit spread for a 30-cent credit. That's a potential 6.4% return (55.5% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 8.9% to cause a problem.\nBearish Trade\nThere are no bearish trades we like on the stock at this time.\nCovered Call Trade\nIf you like the stock, but wish to lower your cost basis on a new position, you may want to consider a June $42.00 covered call. Buy ADM shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the June $42.00 call for a debit of $39.90 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 5.2%, and a target annualized return of 14.4% (for comparison purposes only).\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nOriginally published on InvestorsObserver.com\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

         "ANIK",
         "Epizyme, Inc. (EPZM announced that the FDA has lifted the partial clinical hold on its lead cancer candidate tazemetostat's study. In April, the FDA had paused U.S.-based enrollment of new patients in a phase I pediatric study of tazemetostat, after one patient who had advanced poorly differentiated chordoma developed secondary T-cell lymphoma (T-LBL). This patient then discontinued tazemetostat and started the treatment for T-cell lymphoma.\nEpizyme is in the process of reopening enrollment in all of its company-sponsored studies in the United States, including the follicular lymphoma (FL) EZH2 activating mutation cohort of its phase II non-Hodgkin lymphoma study.\nShares of the company have lost 18.3% year to date compared with the industry 's decline of 2.7%.\nTazemetostat, a first-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, is currently being studied as a monotherapy in ongoing phase II programs in certain molecularly defined solid tumors, including epithelioid sarcoma and other INI1-negative tumors, both follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), mesothelioma, and combination studies in DLBCL and NSCLC.\nThe company along with its team did a comprehensive assessment of the risk of secondary malignancies, including T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) potentially associated with tazemetostat. The company provided a thorough assessment of efficacy and safety data across all of its studies in hematological malignancies and solid tumors, in both adults and children. It convened a panel of external scientific and medical experts, who reviewed and validated the findings.\nThe company through constructive dialogues with the FDA resolved the clinical hold. Epizyme is now focused on its priorities, which include preparing for its first new drug application (NDA) submission for tazemetostat in epithelioid sarcoma and defining its registration path in FL. Epizyme will now engage with regulators in France and Germany to resolve the partial clinical holds, and resume enrollment in those countries.\nEpizyme, Inc. Price\nEpizyme, Inc.

         "ADI",
         "Shares of Pure Storage Inc.PSTG have been performing well of late. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.\nShares of Pure Storage, which provides software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers, have returned 40.7% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry 's growth of 20.9%.\nWhat's Going in Favor of Pure Storage?\nPure Storage is rapidly gaining traction in the flash storage market, as evident from its expanding customer base. In the third quarter, the company added more than 300 customers, bringing the total base to 4,000 organizations and reflecting an increase of 54% from the year-ago quarter.\nNotably, the company's cloud customers contributed around 25% to business while existing customers contributed 70%. The company's strong product portfolio with the likes of FlashArray and FlashBlade business segments was the key catalyst. Additionally, its data platform for cloud is gaining traction.\nManagement is optimistic about its scalable storage solutions in an era where the world is typically being driven by big-data, artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics based information. The company is currently focusing on three major aspects, namely increasing cloud customer base, solidifying the position of its next generation workload related core data infrastructure and tapping large enterprises as they \"cloudify\" their on-premise IT infrastructure.\nManagement is also positive about the company's partner ecosystem, which assisted it in winning a multimillion dollar deal with a prominent financial services institution.\nThe company stated that the storage market for AI is likely to witness CAGR of 78% over the next five years. Pure Storage is well poised to grab the opportunity. Further, its partnership with NVIDIA, which is a dominant player in AI related computation, is anticipated to be a positive.\nNotably, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 66.7% in the last quarter.\nRisks Prevail\nHowever, Pure Storage faces intensifying competition in the flash-based storage market from the likes of Hitachi, NetApp, Dell EMC, HP Enterprise, Lenovo and IBM.\nThe competition has resulted in a decline in the average selling price (\"ASP\"). Any decline in ASP will impact the results if shipments do not improve considerably. This will eventually hurt top-line growth going forward.\nOur Take\nWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat in difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock at the moment.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nPure Storage carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA , Western Digital Corporation WDC and Analog Devices, Inc. ADI are some better-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This will attract customers to the platform and aid revenue generation.\nThis program has already started gaining traction as evident from the participation of Intel, Accenture, Hashicorp, Ecritel, Altran, Micropole and Linkbynet. Further, Station F, the start-up campus has also incorporated the program.\nThe launch of the recent program bodes well for Alibaba's mission of global expansion.\nExpanding Presence in EMEA\nAlibaba is well poised to bolster presence in the EMEA cloud market driven by its rising popularity and strong initial adoption of the program.\nFurther, this program will help the company in supporting advancement of cloud infrastructure and technologies, talent development as well as improving marketplaces in this particular region.\nMoreover, the company recently collaborated with Bollore Group, a France-based transportation company. Per the partnership agreement, Alibaba's cloud computing arm, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network and Bollore's logistics business, Blue Solutions will work together in various global projects, especially in Europe and Africa.\nBollore will make Alibaba's services, content delivery network, big data, artificial intelligence and security solutions available for the businesses it owns across various industries.\nConsequently, this will increase the adoption of Alibaba's services, driving top-line growth.\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM)\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM) | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\nIntensifying Competition\nAlibaba Cloud's continued efforts toward global expansion is likely to boost company's competitive edge in the rapidly growing cloud market against the likes of Amazon AMZN , Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet's GOOGL Google.\nPer the latest report from Research and Markets, the global cloud infrastructure services market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 28.21% between 2018 and 2022.\nAll these cloud providers are trying to fortify their presence in the emerging countries where there is a growing need for cloud infrastructure.\nRecently, Microsoft announced the general availability of Azure in Europe and Middle East to cater to the growing demand for cloud services especially in France, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and UAE.\nFurther, Google has recently expanded its Cloud platform region in the Netherlands. Also, company announced an investment of €150 million for the expansion of its data center based in Dublin. Additionally, Google is planning to launch its cloud services in Switzerland.\nAmazon Web Services (\"AWS\"), which already possess AWS infrastructure region in the U.K., has also expanded its U.K. based datacenter to offer more options of availability zones to customers. Further, the company is gearing up to set up AWS Edge Network Location in the UAE.\nWe believe Alibaba's strong focus toward bolstering cloud business in the EMEA region will continue to strengthen its competitive position in the market.\nCurrently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

         "AEO",
         "In recent years, many teen apparel retailers have filed for bankruptcy due to declining mall traffic, competition from e-tailers and fast-fashion retailers, and shifting teen tastes. However, more resilient apparel retailers have survived by closing stores, expanding their e-commerce initiatives, and launching fresh brands.\nPiper Jaffray recently released its 35th semiannual \" Taking Stock with Teens \" survey of 6,000 teen shoppers across the U.S. In the clothing category, teens favored five brands: Nike (NYSE: NKE) , American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO) , Adidas (NASDAQOTH: ADDYY) , Forever 21, and Urban Outfitters .\nNike's popularity was supported by robust demand for high-end footwear and athletic apparel, but the brand continues to struggle against Adidas in North America. Nike's North American sales fell 6% year over year last quarter, but Adidas' grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by strong demand for its retro styles and Boost foam shoes.\nAmerican Eagle's popularity among teens is rooted in its jeans and female apparel. The company saw comparable-store sales jump 8% last quarter, led by a 34% surge in its Aerie segment. Forever 21 remains ahead of fast-fashion rivals like H&M, while Urban Outfitters' unique blend of kitsch merchandise and apparel lifted the brand's comparable-store sales by 2% in its fiscal fourth quarter.\nOffer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

         "The Bull Case for Alaska Air Group",
         "ALK",
         "Alaska Air 's (NYSE: ALK) profit margin has collapsed over the past year and a half. However, the company has meaningful opportunities to get profit growing again over the next few years.\nIn this episode of Industry Focus: Energy , the team discusses some of Alaska Air's biggest profit growth opportunities. Merger synergies and other revenue initiatives could drive hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental annual earnings by 2021. Fleet renewal could also produce substantial savings. Finally, Alaska Airlines has plenty of room to grow, particularly in California.\nA full transcript follows the video.\n10 stocks we like better than Alaska Air Group\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Alaska Air Group wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\nClick here to learn about these picks!\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018\nThis video was recorded on April 26, 2018.\nSarah Priestley: Adam, I know that you are an Alaska Air shareholder and bullish on the company, and I have to say I'm very impressed by everything I've seen. But, what underlines your thesis?\nAdam Levine-Weinberg: I think it's important to realize that Alaska Air has been producing results recently that have been worse than what the market expected and worse than what I expected. But I still think it has a bright future. The key competitive advantage is lower cost structure relative to the legacy carriers. Alaska estimates its unit cost advantage at 18%, and that's really pretty significant.\nAnother major point in favor of Alaska Air is that you're going to have merger-related synergies and some of the revenue initiatives that were announced just this week kicking in between 2019 and 2020 for the most part. And that could deliver hundreds of millions of dollars to the bottom line by 2020, all else equal. Obviously, if there's a huge jump in oil prices between now and then, or if you have a big increase in competition in some of its markets, those gains could get eroded. But, assuming all else is equal, I think you're going to see a pretty nice improvement in profitability after 2018.\nThere's also lots of long-term growth opportunities in California. As Alaska has noted, the market size there is 3-4X bigger than its historical market in the Pacific Northwest, but it's still actually smaller in California than it is in the Pacific Northwest. So there's really quite a lot of room to grow in places like San Francisco and LA.\nAnd then, the last one is, in the longer-term, especially after 2020, there should be some pretty significant cost savings opportunities by updating Alaska's fleet, particularly the former Virgin America Airbus fleet, which doesn't have as good a unit cost profile as some of the larger planes that are available and will be available with new engines in the next few years.\nPriestley: Yeah, they're just getting increasingly more and more efficient. It's fascinating to watch. I think also, you've definitely touched on this before when we've talked about airlines, it's such a cyclical industry, it's so representative of the health of the economy that it's tied to. With Alaska, that would be the U.S. economy. If you're bullish on the near-term and long-term future of the U.S. economy, then it's definitely worth looking at. I know a lot of investors were spooked by the volatility that we experienced earlier this year, but air travel is certainly only going to increase. And especially as Seattle, its major hub, becomes more and more tech-focused and it expands its reach further down the West Coast, too, and across the country, it's definitely going to become more crucial.\nAdam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Alaska Air Group.

         "Will HIV Sales Drive Gilead (GILD) to Beat in Q2 Earnings?",
         "ABBV",
         "Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc.GILD is likely to beat expectations when it reports results for the second quarter on Jul 25, after the market closes .\nGilead has a decent track record, with the company's earnings beating estimates in three of the last four quaters. In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings missed expectations by 10.8%. Overall, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 4.98%.\nGilead's stock has rallied 9.2% in the year so far, outperforming the industry's decline of 1.8%.\nWhy A Likely Positive Surprise?\nOur proven model indicates that Gilead is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, which is what the case is here, as you will see below.\nZacks ESP : Earnings ESP for Gilead is +0.79%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .\nZacks Rank : Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.\nConversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.\nGilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\nGilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote\nFactors at Play\nWhile the first-quarter results were disappointing, Gilead reiterated its annual guidance with the results. The company continues to expect net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.\nStrong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (\"TAF\") based products - Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch in November 2015.\nAlso, Genvoya has been listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines. In addition, Truvada, for use in pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, continued to maintain momentum with an estimated 167,000 patients using the drug by the end of the first quarter. HIV is one of the primary areas of focus for Gilead and the company is working to bring new HIV treatments to market to further boost sales of the franchise.\nThe company received a major boost when the FDA approved the company's once-daily single tablet regimen (\"STR\"), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection. The recent approval of Biktarvy in Europe will further strengthen the company's HIV franchise.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1.1 billion.\nOn the other hand, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure, leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi have been facing competition from AbbVie's ABBV Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. The franchise suffered a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts.\nWhile pricing has largely stabilized, market share will stabilize by mid-2018 and patient starts are expected to decline further. HCV revenues are projected to decline further and will constitute a smaller portion of the top line, going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni are $34 million and $285 million, respectively.\nGiven the persistent decline in HCV sales, the company is looking to newer avenues to help its top line. The Kite acquisition was a step in the right direction with the FDA approval of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.\nThe initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging in the United States. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion on the company's Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the therapy in Europe.\nGilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates, selonsertib and filgotinib. Both the candidates are being evaluated in late stage studies and a tentative approval will diversify Gilead's portfolio. We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the second-quarter's call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.\nOther Stocks to Consider\nHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.\nIntercept Pharmaceuticals ICPT is expected to report second-quarter results on Jul 30. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nAcorda Therapeutics, Inc. ACOR is scheduled to release second-quarter results on Aug 2. The company has an Earnings ESP of +66.7% and a Zacks Rank #2.\nWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?\nHere's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.\nWith battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.\nIt's not the one you think.\nSee This Ticker Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

         "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL - December 18, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article are Insperity, Inc.NSP , CBRE Group, Inc.CBRE , The Boeing CompanyBA , American Express CompanyAXP and BJ's Restaurants, Inc.BJRI .\nThese 5 Stocks Sport Impressive Interest Coverage Ratios\nWe often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.\nA critical analysis of a company's financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on \"Interest Coverage,\" which is one such ratio.\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense .\nWhy Interest Coverage Ratio?\nInterest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.\nDebt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.\nInterest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.\nAn interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.\nFor the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks.com at: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/343474/these-5-stocks-sport-impressive-interest-coverage-ratio\nDisclosure: Officers, directors and/or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and/or hold long and/or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material.

         "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: AES, NextEra Energy, JinkoSolar Holding and First Solar",
         "AES",
         "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL - April 16, 2018 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry: Alternative Energy, Part 2, including AES Corp. AES , NextEra Energy NEE , JinkoSolar Holding JKS and First Solar FSLR.\nIndustry: Alternative Energy, Part 2\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/157971/alternative-energy-sees-cost-cuts-corporate-ventures\nThe broad consensus on the man-made nature of climate change notwithstanding, policies of the current U.S. administration run counter to it and favorable to the coal industry. But not all is lost - as a big part of the corporate sector and many local governments remain committed to taking steps to ensure a cleaner energy environment.\nIn keeping with this, the RE100 collaborative global initiative has brought together some of the biggest U.S. companies from different sectors, with a target to source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. As such, the demand for electricity generated from renewable sources is no longer restricted to a few companies.\nOn the supply side, technological improvements have been helping bring down solar and wind power prices and the cost of energy storage, which have been acting in favor of the alternative energy industry.\nHere we take a look at the alternative energy space in an attempt to identify its strengths.\nSupply Growth : The underlying driver for the alternative energy industry is significantly high demand outlook for renewables. According to the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017, U.S. demand for renewable energy is forecast to reach 12.6 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) by 2021. While demand for solar energy is projected to rise 20% annually, the same for wind energy is likely to rise 7.2%. Currently, the primary advantage of using solar or wind energy is their abundant supply. This allows renewables to score higher than fossil fuel, which is exhaustible. Therefore, we expect the renewable space to continue to innovate to offer consumers clean and affordable energy. This should help stocks in this space maintain strong momentum in the days ahead.\nDeclining Costs : There's no denying the fact that a steep drop in the cost of wind and solar energy has been helping the demand outlook for alternative energy. Per a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar photovoltaic (PV) modules prices had dropped more than 80% in 2017 from 2009. The cost of electricity from solar PV fell almost three-quarters in 2010-2017 and continues to decline. The drop in electricity costs from utility-scale solar PV projects since 2010 has been remarkable as well. The global weighted average cost of electricity (LCOE) of utility-scale solar PV has fallen 73% since 2010 for new projects commissioned in 2017.\nMeanwhile, the cost of wind turbines is the single largest component which makes up for 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project. Notably, wind turbine prices have fallen by around half over a similar period, leading to cheaper wind power globally. Onshore wind electricity costs dropped almost a quarter in 2017 from 2010.\nMoreover, hydropower is one of the cheapest and also the largest source of renewable electricity. The global weighted average LCOE of large-scale hydro projects in 2016 was $0.053/kWh, which had dropped to $0.047/kWh in 2017. The report by IRENA projects that, electricity from renewables will soon be consistently cheaper than from fossil fuels. By 2020, current power generation technologies from renewables under commercial use will become cost effective compared to cost of fossil fuels. This will give rise to higher preference of renewable energy.\nSolid Growth Prospects : In EIA's 2017 International Energy Outlook's (IEO) Reference case, worldwide net electricity generation is projected to increase 45% in 2015 to 34 trillion kWh in 2040. Notably, electricity is the world's fastest-growing form of end-use energy and renewables are likely to become a major source for electricity generation, with average increase of 2.8% per year from 2015 to 2040.\nBeing a major forerunner in renewables, no doubt these growth prospects will boost the United States' alternative energy industry over the long run, even if we consider Trump's latest moves against clean energy revolution. In this context, EIA earlier stated that even if the Clean Power Plan is abolished, the U.S. renewable space will continue to grow albeit at a slower rate. EIA projected U.S. renewable generation capacity growth by an average of 1.9% per year between 2017 and 2050. So, long-term global prospects continue to improve for the U.S. alternative energy industry.\nRole of the Private Sector : Plummeting costs of wind and solar power along with grid developments have prompted global corporations to consider the clean energy space for their business strategies. In fact, after realizing the opportunities in the renewable energy space, many big corporate houses have joined the RE100 initiative. To make the most of this opportunity, U.S. majors have enrolled themselves in this program to minimize their carbon footprint and deploy more renewable energy. For instance, Google and Wells Fargo announced that they had reached 100% renewable electricity consumption in late 2017.\nMoreover, with solar being an attractive investment target within renewable, companies from other domains have started to invest in solar stocks. In March 2018, Microsoft announced the single largest corporate purchase of solar power in the United States by signing an agreement with sPower - a subsidiary of AES Corp.- to add 315 MW of electricity via two solar projects in Virginia.\nExtension of Tax Credits : Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the $1.15 trillion federal spending bill of December 2015, wherein Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators. The new environmental tax credit extension allowed solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits (\"ITC\") at 30% of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners.\nMoreover, the wind power industry benefited significantly from the production tax credit (\"PTC\") extension. The PTC, which had expired at 2014-end due to congressional gridlock, was extended through 2020. In December 2017, a Republican tax bill was released that preserved key tax credits that were feared of being abolished by the Trump administration.\nThe final tax bill retained the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar energy that have spurred investment in the fast-growth industries. It also eliminated the alternative minimum tax, which would have reduced the value of those credits. This surely came as a relief for those in the renewable energy industry, which according to SEIA employs 260,000 workers.\nChina's Solar Plans : While we have already discussed the growth prospects of the U.S. solar market in our Alternative Energy Stock Outlook , China continues to hold the leading position in solar-power installations across the globe. As per Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), Chinese overseas investment in clean energy projects was a record $44 billion in 2017, compared to 2016's investment of $32 billion. For certain, a bulk of that investment went to the United States as it is a major solar market.\nWith China being its largest importer for solar panels and modules, the U.S. renewable energy industry largely depends on Chinese manufacturers. Although the latest imposition of import tax on solar modules have created possibilities of trade war between China and America, Chinese companies are maintaining their offshore investments in the United Sates to tap in on the bountiful opportunities.\nIn March 2018, NextEra Energy announced an agreement to purchase solar panel from Chinese solar module manufacturer - JinkoSolar Holding. Over the next four years, JinkoSolar will supply approximately 2,750 MW of high-efficiency solar modules to NextEra Energy. Production of the solar panels will start in the second half of 2018.\nIndia's Solar Initiatives : While China and the United States have led the Solar industry in recent years, Asia's third-largest economy, India, has lately joined the list of solar power markets with a target of adding 175 GW of solar, wind and other renewable energy by 2022.\nIndia is striving to bump up its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022, which will include 60 GW from grid-connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar. According to a new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the country added 715 megawatts in rooftop PV power in 2017, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 117% since 2013. This has kindled the interest of U.S. solar players in India's market.\nCompany-wise, First Solar has ample businesses in India and together with local firms is investing considerably in the country. During 2017, the company executed definitive sales agreements for two projects totaling 155 MW AC and commissioned two additional projects totalling 40 MW AC in Karnataka. It continues to maintain a strong presence in India with over 1.8 GW DC of installed modules.\nBoom in Offshore Wind Projects : The United States is one of the largest and fastest-growing wind markets in the world. The U.S. wind industry is an important component of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) strategy to cut carbon pollution, diversify the nation's energy economy and bring the next generation of American-made clean energy technologies to market.\nSeveral key factors are driving the long-awaited take-off of U.S. offshore wind. These factors include innovations of sophisticated turbine technologies and economies of scale that are driving down costs. Surprisingly, the Trump administration, which had aggressively promoted the development of fossil fuels over renewable energy, seems to be supporting the offshore wind energy sector. According to the DOE, more than 25 offshore wind projects with a generating capacity of 24 GW are now being planned, mainly off the U.S. Northeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.\nIn December 2017, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry announced the creation of a consortium to develop innovative offshore wind technologies. Notably, 90% of the announced $18.5 million in federal funding for the consortium will go to research and development, largely to cut down turbine costs and improve turbine efficiency. Although the offshore wind industry is currently at a nascent stage and the cost of installation in sea is high, with technological advancements prices are projected to decline eventually thereby improving the industry's competitive position. With almost 80% of U.S. electricity demand coming from coastal states, offshore wind energy has the potential to contribute significantly to a cleaner energy environment.\nStrong Stocks that Should Be in the News\nMany are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar.

         "ARAY",
         "Accuray IncorporatedARAY recently announced that its flagship CyberKnife System has been successfully treated the first patient at Erasmus MC - the largest university medical center in the Netherlands. Notably, the device was used to treat oligometastases in the pelvic region, using an online-adaptive (OA) approach.\nThe trial was conducted at Erasmus MC evaluating OA stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered by the CyberKnife platform. Per management, this trial is effective in controlling cancer in a specific organ and reducing toxin in patients, diagnosed with pelvic or intra-abdominal oligometastases. Radiation therapy for such diseases is quite challenging.\nTo address this issue, Accuray and Erasmus MC are partnering to develop an integrated, advanced, imaging solution tailored for use with the CyberKnife System.\nIn this regard, it should be noted that CyberKnife has been a major contributor to revenues for Accuray in the first half of 2018. Moreover, it favorably impacted the company's gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nHence, the latest move is likely to prove beneficial for the California-based developer of radiotherapy systems.\nCancer Trends in Europe\nPer research by the WHO, Europe records more than 3.7 million new cases of cancer, with 1.9 million deaths, every year. Cancer is the second most important cause of death and morbidity in Europe.\nIncreasing levels of tobacco and alcohol consumption along with obesity are believed to be the major factors.\nPrice Performance\nIn the past six months, Accuray's shares have gained 22.5%, compared with the industry 's rallied of 9.8%.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nAccuray carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth, Inc. ATHN , Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. BIO and Centene Corporation CNC . Each of these stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

         "Here's Why You Should Dump Allegiant From Your Portfolio",
         "ALGT",
         "Allegiant Travel CompanyALGT has been plagued with numerous headwinds, of late. In fact, factors like capacity-related woes, safety-related issues and escalating fuel costs have resulted in the Allegiant stock shedding 10.2% of its value so far this year.\nYTD Price Performance\nReasons for the Lackluster Performance\nHigh fuel and labor costs have been limiting the carrier's bottom-line growth for quite some time now and the second quarter of 2018 is likely to be no different. In May, fuel costs at Allegiant were approximately $2.44 per gallon, higher than the April reading of $2.28 per gallon. With oil prices on an uptrend, Allegiant might revise its current-year fuel price guidance of $2.20 per gallon upward in the near future. High labor costs may also weigh on the company's bottom-line performance.\nWe note that Allegiant is not the sole airline company to suffer from high fuel costs. Other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. LUV , JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL are also being hurt by the rise in one of the largest input costs for any airline.\nAdditionally, capacity-related woes have been hurting Allegiant for quite some time and the company's May traffic report was no exception. In May, system capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), expanded 10.7% to 1.23 billion. Notably, capacity expansion was more in May compared with 9% in April, giving rise to capacity-overexpansion related fears.\nMeanwhile, Allegiant is still suffering from CBS News' report, 60 Minutes, alleging that it was facing a number of safety-related issues. The damaging television program was aired on Apr 15. The allegations are being investigated.\nFurthermore, Allegiant's high debt levels are concerning. The fact that it is a highly leveraged company is quite evident from the ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage), which is currently in excess of 100. This compares unfavorably to the figure of 92.6% for its industry .\nUnfavorable Readings\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and 2018 earnings moved south 1.8% and 2%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor's pessimism surrounding the stock. Moreover, the company exhibits a Momentum Score of D, which highlights its short-term unattractiveness.\nUndoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nHowever, you can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nOur View\nSimilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Allegiant seems to one such stock, which has witnessed downward earnings estimate revisions and has an unfavorable Zacks Rank.\nTherefore, if you are still holding on to shares of Allegiant in your portfolio, we believe that it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.\nWall Street's Next Amazon\nZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.\nClick for details >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

         "Is Appian Stock a Buy?",
         "APPN",
         "Cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) just reported second-quarter 2018 results which exhibited strong top-line growth, although operations continue to lose money. The stock hasn't been around for a long while, as Appian went public in the spring of 2017, but shares have had an impressive run since their debut. Though owning a piece of Appian isn't for every investor, its losses shouldn't deter those looking for a long-term growth play in the technology space.\nA recap of performance\nAppian provides a low-code software development platform, helping businesses without the resources to hire engineers (or those simply looking to speed up the development process) build apps, websites, and other software. Rather than requiring line-by-line coding, Appian's visual tools look more like a flow chart, and the service is set up so that even those with limited coding knowledge can build applications. That is a valuable resource in a world where software engineers are in short supply .\nSince going public, Appian has reported admirable growth. Trailing-12-month revenues are up more than 40% during that time, and the stock has followed suit:\nData by YCharts .\nThe top-line trend remains vigorous as year-to-date in 2018, demand for Appian's cloud-based development tools and other professional services remains strong. The company's subscription revenue retention rate in the second quarter of 2018 was 119%. Revenue retention measures the dollar volume growth of retained services, versus the number of customers retained. A reading in excess of 100% indicates that customers are on average increasing their spending with Appian. Below are some additional key metrics:\nData source: Appian quarterly earnings.\nDon't sweat the red\nThe company's top line looks great, but what about those losses? Appian's gross margin north of 60% is getting gobbled up and then some by operating expenses, making for an ugly-looking bottom line.\nBefore tackling that, it's first worth acknowledging that Appian's subscription services carry a much higher gross profit margin than the labor-intensive professional services: Gross margin in the two revenue streams hit 91% and 30%, respectively, in the second quarter. However, has Appian chosen to build out its professional services division, which converts to revenue faster, to help fuel its overall business. Subscription services take longer to convert into revenue, yet the profit margins are extremely high.\nSubscriptions, software and support is now the faster-growing segment, and it's contributing more gross profit by far. To help speed up overall revenue expansion, Appian has dumped $50.3 million into sales and advertising so far this year. That's 45% of total sales, and it doesn't include another 18.5% of total sales being invested in research and development.\nThese two line items explain the losses at Appian. While seeing that much red may be alarming, the context shows a company that is investing in itself and getting rewarded with double-digit revenue growth.\nFor 2018, Appian expects its full-year subscription revenues and total revenues to increase 34% and 21%, respectively, from 2017. Professional services growth is slowing down and is the primary drag on the overall figure -- some of the upward trajectory the company has enjoyed as of late is expected to cool off during the back half of the year. However, while operating expenses keep expanding, the percentage loss compared to sales is slowly edging lower.\nAppian's stock can be a volatile ride as a result of its ambitious growth endeavors. As the company funnels cash to its sales engine, changes in the momentum of new client acquisition and existing client spending -- specifically on the software subscription side -- can cause big advances and declines in share price. Investors should therefore be cautious before making a purchase, and those who can't stomach the gyrations or who have a shorter time before they need their money should exercise caution.\nFor those seeking a long-term growth story, though, Appian looks like a solid option. In a world where digital transformation is happening at breakneck speed, the company's low-code services could play an increasingly important role in helping organizations which are trying to keep up. Just remember to keep bets on Appian small to manage the risk.\nFind out why Appianis one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

         "ALNY",
         "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.REGN and partner Sanofi SNY announced that they will expand their investment for the development of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, cemiplimab, in oncology and label expansion of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody, dupilumab, in Type II allergic diseases.\nPer the terms of the expansion, the investment in cemiplimab will be increased to $1.64 billion, an increase of about $1 billion, over the initial 2015 agreement. Meanwhile, Sanofi and Regeneron will continue to equally fund cemiplimab development. Currently, the companies are developing cemiplimab as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas, with more studies in other indications planned to begin in 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron expect to submit regulatory filings in the United States and Europe for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\nThe increased investment in the label expansion of dupilumab development program will enable the companies to speed up the planned new studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peanut allergy and grass allergy as well as in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. The new funding will also support the acceleration and expansion of development of REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, in atopic dermatitis, asthma and COPD.\nShares of Regeneron have increased 5% against the industry 's decline of 2.8% in the past one year.\nRegeneron has agreed to a limited waiver of the \"lock-up\" clause with Sanofi, thereby enabling the latter to sell a small percentage of the Regeneroncommon stock it owns to fund a portion of the increased investment. Specifically, Sanofi will be allowed to sell up to 1.4 million shares of Regeneroncommon stock to the latter through the end of 2020. This represents about 6% of the 23.9 million shares of Regeneron Sanofi currently owns.If Regeneron opts out of the deal, Sanofi may sell them in the open market.\nIn a separate release, the company also announced collaborations with AbbVie, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals ALNY , AstraZeneca, Biogen and Pfizer Inc. PFE that will speed its effort to collect genetic information on 500,000 people in the UK Biobank database, a project that could help speed up new drug discovery and improve approval success rates.\nThe collaborators will each commit $10 million to enable the speeding up of sequencing timelines and additional companies are considering joining the consortium. It was originally planned that sequencing of all 500,000 samples in the UK Biobank would be completed by 2022. But with the inclusion of these companies, it will be possible to complete the exome sequencing of all 500,000 participants by the end of 2019, with all data made broadly available by UK Biobank to researchers by the end of 2020.\nThis consortium effort thus largely accelerates delivery to the global scientific community of the largest 'big data' resource linking human sequence data to other health-related information. Sequencing of UK Biobank's samples will continue to be performed at the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) facility, one of the world's largest and most sophisticated human genetics sequencing centers.\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

         "4 Solid Insurance Stock Picks: Can These Continue the Bull Run?",
         "AEL",
         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nAs the year 2018 set in, the insurance industry started to witness the wheel of fortune turning in its favor with the rising interest rates, improving economy, lower-than-expected catastrophe loss (as compared to 2017, which emerged as the costliest year in terms of cat loss) as well as a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018.\nSource: GotCredit\nHence, the industry is anticipated to deliver better-than-expected results and continue the momentum in the near term as well.\nEven though the insurers will be faced with challenges to counter in 2018, their primary focus remains on achieving two important objectives - top-line sales growth while bolstering bottom-line profitability.\nSome of the concerns such as weather-related events and political turmoil are beyond the insurers' control. Despite these trials, we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock.\n4 Best Insurance Stocks to Buy After Fed Rate Hike\nHere, we will talk about a few driving factors that might help insurers perform well in the near future, allaying apprehensions among investors.\nRising Interest Rates: Is it a Blessing?\nThe gradually improving interest rates have been a boon for insurers, who are major beneficiaries of the rising interest rates. The FOMC meeting on Mar 21, 2018, which also marked Jerome Powell's first Fed meeting as chairman, further strengthened the insurers' confidence in the regulatory body's promise to deliver three rate hikes in 2018.\nThe first hike announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the range of 1.50-1.75%. In fact, the Fed indicated that there can be a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019 (one more than the previously announced two hikes), hinting at an aggressive path of rate hikes.\nA progressive rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry with regard to insurers' investment income (forming a major portion of their revenues), thereby accelerating their overall growth in the future.\n5 Quality Picks as Fed Hikes Rate, Turns Hawkish for 2019\nFor instance, life insurance companies will get a relief from the operating pressures, resulting from tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. Rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide the required relief to insurers to maintain decent margins.\nBetter Underwriting Performance: An Ambitious Hope?\nAlthough the California mudslides and the northeast winter storms are likely to impact first-quarter 2018 results with Chubb Ltd (NYSE: CB ) projecting a total catastrophe loss of $305 million after tax, the insurers are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results. Thus, the positivity surrounding a better underwriting performance remains intact, despite such massive inclement weather-oriented losses being incurred.\nIn fact, per a report by Fitch Ratings, the insurance industry is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slower pace, after being badly hit by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017. Moreover, combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to a break-even point.\n5 Amazing Top-Ranked ETFs and Stocks on Sale\nCapital strength displayed by the insurers will assist them to counter near-term volatility and the effects of adverse events.\nOther High Points for a Winning Performance\nThere are a few other factors poised to boost the insurance industry this year. The unemployment rate is projected at 3.8% in 2018 while the gross domestic product is likely to grow 2.7% (an increase from the earlier estimate of 2.5%). Both represent a bullish economic outlook, further picking pace in the recent months.\nThis apart, a recovering housing market looks set to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.\nMoreover, the tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is an attractive option for most corporates including insurers, as it will aid the companies' bottom-line, boosting margins directly.\n4 Consumer Staples Stocks That Gained Over 10% in 3 Months\nA strong liquidity profile, attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry, will not only back the insurers to counter near-term volatility and impact of hostile occurrences but will also keep the industry's growth trend alive.\nKey Picks\nDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year, tailwinds like rising interest rate environment, better underwriting results and steadily thriving economy will probably cushion the following stocks to raise the performance bar and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification.\nWe have zeroed in on four stocks outperforming despite all odds. We expect these stocks to continue the bull run given positive estimate revisions, a favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive VGM Score of A or B.\nThe 6 Most Inexpensive Growth Stocks to Buy Now\nOur research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities.\nSolid Insurance Stock Picks: Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG)\nRolling Meadows, IL-based Arthur J.

This is reflected via the company's Zacks Rank of 2.\nMoreover, the company has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank #2, translating into containing the right combination of two key elements to outpace estimates in the first quarter.\n3 Emerging Technologies Set to Transform the Pharma World\nThe stock has a VGM Score of B and has gained 8.2% compared with the industry 's increase of 0.9% in a year's time.\nToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies\nIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.\nAnd this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

         "The 3 Best Machine Leaning Stocks to Buy in 2019",
         "AI",
         "Machine learning is a subset of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) market. Chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) defines the technology as \"... the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.\" In short, it's the tech that allows computers to learn from the data that they've been given in order to draw a conclusion, without having to be pre-programmed to do so.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and NVIDIA have already integrated machine learning into parts of their businesses, with great results. With these tech giants already making big moves in this space, 2019 may be a good time for investors to start betting on these machine learning leaders.\nAlphabet's being driven by machine learning\nOne of the most direct ways Alphabet uses machine learning right now is through the company's self-driving vehicle company Waymo. Waymo j ust launched its commercial autonomous ride-hailing service a few weeks ago, making it a leader in this nascent market, and the machine learning software that's driving the vehicles is second to none.\nWaymo's tech allows its fleet of vehicles to not just process the visual information around them (like where other cars are, where pedestrians are walking, etc.), but to also learn from all of the interactions it has while driving and apply what it learns to future trips.\nThe company's machine learning systems have been able to improve how Waymo's cars drive because they've been fed lots of data from the the 10 million miles they've driven on the road and the 7 billion virtual miles they've driven through computer scenarios.\nThe benefit for Alphabet will come from Waymo selling rides to the public (which will expand more next year) and licensing its technology to automakers, and potentially from automated package delivery services. When combined, those businesses will give Waymo an estimated value of about $175 billion according to Morgan Stanley .\nAmazon's behind-the-scenes machine learning uses\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been relatively outspoken about his company's use of machine learning, and has even gone so far as to say that it's used in every part of the company's business. The most apparent machine learning use comes in the form of figuring out where and how items will be on the Amazon website for users to see, and which products Amazon recommends to its users. Bezos said last year that:\n\"Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type -- quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.\"\nBut more recently, Amazon has apparently also been looking to machine learning to help drive its fast-growing advertising business. The company recently posted a job online for a machine learning and data scientist to help the company with video ads on its site. Amazon mentioned that the new hire would need to \"Utilize machine learning and analytical techniques\" to create solutions across the company's business, including its ad-serving pipeline.\nAdditionally, a recent AdAge article noted that Amazon is \"developing data and analytics tools for brands, backed by machine learning and its ubiquitous web services\" so that it can use the tech to find relevant data for ad targeting and measure ad success.\nAmazon's machine learning focus for advertising purposes matters because the company's advertising business is already the third-largest digital ad platform in the U.S., and is quickly becoming a vital part of Amazon's overall business. By 2021 Amazon's advertising business will bring in an estimated $16 billion in operating income, outpacing the company's cloud services revenue that year.\nNVIDIA's machine learning play\nNVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are used by the world's largest technology companies to help their servers implement machine learning services. But the company has also used its GPUs to build semi-autonomous driving technology .\nNVIDIA's Drive PX Pegasus system allows vehicles to see and process the images captured by onboard cameras so that the vehicles can correctly navigate their surroundings. NVIDIA says its GPUs are used in Pegasus' deep learning , a type of machine learning, to give vehicles computer vision to understand their surroundings. NVIDIA's Pegasus is already being used by more than 25 companies to develop fully autonomous robotaxis that can drive themselves.\nNVIDIA believes that autonomous vehicles represent a $60 billion total addressable market for the company by 2035. That may be a long way off, but 2019 is already shaping up to be a pivotal year for autonomous driving services, and the market will likely ramp up over the new few years.\nBeyond 2019\nOf course, there's no guarantee that these companies will see their share prices skyrocket in 2019. But these companies are already heavily invested in machine learning, and are keeping a long-term perspective in mind for how they'll benefit from it.\nInvestors who take a similar approach to machine learning will likely be rewarded as they wait for the artificial intelligence market, including machine learning, to grow. But that means they'll probably have to wait beyond 2019 to see significant returns.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

         "AINC",
         "Ashford (AINC) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.60 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.73 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 82.74%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this asset management company serving the hospitality industry would post earnings of $1.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of -10.47%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\nAshford, which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, posted revenues of $54.81 million for the quarter ended June 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $19.64 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nAshford shares have lost about 6.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.9%.\nWhat's Next for Ashford?\nWhile Ashford has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ashford was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.80 on $34.33 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.02 on $161.63 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

         "AAL",
         "The major cut to the corporate tax rate that Republicans in Washington just enacted will be a windfall for U.S. corporations, a few of which are making a point of passing some of their good fortune on to their employees.\nBut as host Mac Greer and guests Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser of Million Dollar Portfolio point out in this segment of the MarketFoolery podcast, one-time bonuses like those issued by leading passenger carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) are more PR moves than anything else. So where will the lion's share of these corporate tax gifts get spent? And looking specifically at these two companies and their industry, what is the outlook for airlines? The Fools discuss.\nA full transcript follows the video.\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Wal-Mart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\nClick here to learn about these picks!\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 2, 2018\nThe author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.\nThis video was recorded on Jan. 3, 2018.\nMac Greer: Let's go ahead and start with more news about the new tax law, and companies paying bonuses. Matt, this time, news that's American Airlines and Southwest both announcing plans to give employees a $1,000 bonus due to the new tax law. That came out on Tuesday, that announcement. Now, Matt, there's been a lot of speculation about how companies might use their tax savings. We're starting to get some evidence, based on these bonuses. Southwest also saying they're going to exercise an option to buy 40 jets from Boeing . What do you make of it all?\nMatt Argersinger: This comes on the heels of news from Wells Fargo doing something similar. A few other companies -- American Express , I think, was also paying one-time bonuses to employees. These are nice, and no one is going to complain about getting an extra thousand dollars in a paycheck. But something like this reeks of public-relations opportunism. \"Hey, we got a big corporate tax break, so let's do something nice in the short term for employees.\" It certainly helps the image. It helps the CEO. It's a nice story. But this kind of stuff in the long term isn't going to mean a lot for workers or how corporations employ capital.\nI think why this could be a little different, and why we might see more hiring and more investment going forward is, there's been a permanent change to the corporate tax rate. It's down to 21% from 35%. So if I'm the CFO of a company, any company, especially a growing company in the U.S., I'm not spending a lot of time now looking for tax savings abroad or fishing for loopholes in the tax code where I can make more on the bottom line, because now essentially, I live in a tax haven in the U.S. So I feel like we're going to see a lot more evidence as the year goes on about more investment.\nI know Jason is going to make a point -- not all of it is going to be really effectively hiring or raising wages or things like that that we'd like to see. But I think it's going to have a real positive impact on corporations and employees going forward.\nGreer: That's interesting, because a lot of the speculation, Jason, leading up to the tax bill, there were surveys, and a lot of people speculating that these companies are primarily going to take those tax savings and use them for share buybacks and maybe hike dividends. And Matt, you seem to be saying, maybe not so fast.\nArgersinger: I think that's going to be good, and I think it's going to be great for shareholders and investors like us. But I do think, because there's been a permanent change in the tax code versus previous times when we've had temporary special one-year tax things you can do, it is going to have an impact. It might not be as great, and I think a lot of those new dollars are going to go to buybacks and dividends. But I think there's going to be some meaningful reinvestment in business going forward as well.\nJason Moser: I don't disagree. I feel like we're going to see a little bit of a lot of it. You have to go back and look at history to give us some ideas of what might be done with this money. Go back to 2004, where there was a tax holiday. It was part of the American Jobs Creation Act. Facts that went back and put some numbers together, and overwhelmingly that tax holiday money was used for share buybacks and dividends, whether they be special dividends or increases into the regular dividend. So that's great. As an investor, generally speaking, you have to feel pretty good about that.\nNow, the flip side of that is, we also see the numbers bear out over time that companies usually do a pretty crappy job at share buybacks. They buy back when the stock is at all-time highs, and then, when the bottom falls out, they really tighten the purse strings. And really, you kind of want to see them take advantage of those buybacks when the stock is cratering. And that can be a little bit of a difficult thing to do sometimes, because perhaps these companies don't necessarily have these vast financial resources. I think we're going to see a lot of these vast financial resources open up here with this tax holiday, or this new tax structure, coming in.\nTo me, I look at these $1,000 bumps that all of these companies are offering, and yeah, on the surface it's great. It does offer some good publicity. It's a wonderful headline for these companies. A little bit of a tip of the cap to the lower tax rate makes everybody feel good, and it certainly gets folks on both sides of the argument arguing a little bit more. It's just a drop in the bucket, though. It's a drop in the bucket, it's a one time thing, and it really doesn't tell us what they're going to do beyond that. We'd love to see them spend more money. The only thing that's going to really tell us that is hindsight, though -- looking back and actually seeing if actions do, in fact, speak louder than words.\nBut I think Matt made a good point there. This gives a lot of CFOs -- their typical mandate is to figure out how to minimize that tax rate. They don't have to focus as much, at least. I think they're going to continue to try to figure out how to get that tax rate even lower, because generally speaking, people don't want to pay taxes. I get that. But by the same token, this is going to give them a little more transparency, a little bit more of an ability to plan for the future. And I think that could ultimately be a good thing.\nArgersinger: Part of the dilemma here is, U.S. corporations in particular didn't need this. If you look at the balance sheets of most U.S. corporations, great shape. Lots of cash; very low-cost debt. Whether or not you have a 35% tax rate or a 21% tax rate, it was fine. They were making plenty of money. So I think one thing you will see, in addition to buybacks and dividends for sure, and maybe a little hiring, a little bit of capital investment, is I think you're going to see more acquisitions now.\nTwo reasons for that. We're looking for returns now. Corporations are flush, lower tax rate -- where am I going to get the returns? If I can't get it from reinvesting in the business or R&D, new capital investment, or even hiring, I'm going to look where I can make acquisitions to add to the business. And two, I don't want to delve into politics at all here, but from reading conference calls lately, interviews with CEOs, there's at least a sense that the climate is more business-friendly. This administration, for all it's worth, is a little more business-friendly. So the idea of doing big corporate deals, unless there's some kind of angle there that our favorite president doesn't like, probably going to get the green light. And that's in regard to the later stages of a bull market as well. You're going to see some big acquisitions. 2018 might even be a record year for it.\nGreer: Let's pivot to the two companies here that we're talking about, Southwest and American Airlines. Matt, I know in the past year, you've had some bullish things to say about airlines. What do you think about the airlines going forward?\nArgersinger: I think it's a great time to be interested in buying or investing in airlines. For reasons I've said before, the consolidation we've seen, the time they've taken to improve their balance sheets, the pricing power that they have now, the hub-and-spoke routes that have been made more efficient for airports and things like that, it favors the big four airlines in the U.S. So when I see things like Southwest announcing that they're executing a contract by, I forget what it was, how many more planes from Boeing. Delta made a big deal with Airbus recently to buy new planes. These are big investments they're making, because they see the opportunities, they see the pricing power, they see a future where oil prices aren't going to crush them anymore. I'm a big fan of investing in airlines right now.\nGreer: Well, this may be totally unfair, but I have some breaking news that may weigh on your investing thesis.

You know, I'm reassessing my thesis right now, Mac.\nGreer: Now, what strikes you as odd about that sentence? Because I've been obsessed with this story. Let me read it again. \"Alaska Airlines is calling in an exterminator after the company says a rat boarded one of its planes.\" Can a rat board a plane? Doesn't boarding suggest permission and intent?\nArgersinger: Yeah, it does seem strange to me. Did he go through customs? Did he go through the luggage?\nGreer: He jumped on the plane from the jetway. But you can't board a plane, can you, unless you intend to? And someone gives you permission?\nMoser: Well, I don't know that permission is necessary.\nGreer: Can a rat board a plane? Marketfoolery@fool.com.\nArgersinger: Let us know.\nGreer: That's the question. I don't know. I think that's the wrong word. It's not Stuart Little here. He's not getting his boarding pass.\nMoser: A rat was found. Boarding the plane. That really implies that someone saw him. And then, you're letting a rat on the plane?\nGreer: No!\nArgersinger: Here's the question --\nMoser: Snuck on the plane. Hopped on a plane.\nGreer: Stormed the plane.\nMoser: There you go.\nArgersinger: -- if I'm a passenger, is the plane now not moving because there's a rat there? And poor passengers have to wait --\nGreer: They canceled the flight. They pulled everyone off.\nArgersinger: Oh, no way.\nGreer: Yeah, no, I love this. \"Alaska Airlines says it will resume using the plane when a professional exterminator certifies that it is rodent-free.\"\nArgersinger: I guarantee you, if you ask 95% of the passengers on that plane, and they said, \"Hey, we can either fly with a rat on board or we can cancel.\"\nGreer: No way.\nArgersinger: You wouldn't fly with a rat on board?\nGreer: No, because he could chew through the cables. No way. I mean, if it's like Stuart Little , if he truly boarded the plane and he has a little carry-on and he's well-behaved, that's fine. But most rats aren't that.\nArgersinger: So you're flying home after the holidays, or for the holidays --\nGreer: No. You have to think what the rat could do. He could get in the cockpit and chew through the autopilot or something. I don't know.\nArgersinger: I guess that's true.\nGreer: Not that you could chew through the autopilot. But I'm just thinking, it just takes one cable.\nArgersinger: That's true.\nMoser: It's better than a scorpion. A few months back, there were reports of a scorpion that was found on the plane, and that, to me, that makes a rat a little more tolerable.\nGreer: I'd take a scorpion before the rat.\nArgersinger: There would have to be a dozen snakes on the plane before I would be like, \"Cancel my flight.\" I want to go home.\nGreer: Let's not lose focus here. The issue here is, I don't think a rat can, quote, \"board\" a plane. I think \"board\" suggests permission and intent.\nArgersinger: Yeah.\nMoser: I agree.\nGreer: This is important.\nMoser: They probably fired the employee that actually let the rat board. That's what you're telling me.\nGreer: Exactly. Then again, if the rat had the wherewithal to buy a ticket and present a boarding pass in a timely fashion...\nMoser: That's a smart rat.\nGreer: There you go. So, moving on. [laughs] That's so unfair. That doesn't change your thesis on the airlines?\nArgersinger: No, I'm still bullish on airlines.\nGreer: OK.\nJason Moser has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

         "What The Apple HomePod Means For AAPL Investors",
         "BB",
         "HomePod (Photo courtesy of Apple)\nThis morning, we learned that the Apple (AAPL) HomePod will be available to order Friday, with an expected delivery date of February 9. The HomePod is the Cupertino giant’s home speaker system, their answer to Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Google (GOOGL)’s Home. We knew it was coming and, based on history, now that it is here we know what the reactions will be.\nThe doubters will point out that Apple is late to the party. They will state with absolute certainty that the HomePod, due to its delayed entry into the market, will fail terribly, and could be the beginning of the end of Apple. Many, including many investors and analysts who should know better, will believe them, and AAPL will probably underperform for a while as a result.\nStudents of the company’s history, however, will use that weakness as an opportunity to load up on stock in what is arguably the most successful company in the history of the world.\nWhat the doubters forget is that we have been through this many times before, and each time those that maintain that Apple has made a mistake have been proven wrong. Re-making an existing product, or expanding on an idea, is what Apple has been doing for years, and they do it better than anybody else. They don’t steal ideas, they improve on them.\nThink of the watch, years after Fitbit (FIT) and Samsung Gear, or the move towards larger phones, or any one of a host of things dating back to the release of the iPhone when Blackberry (BB) dominated the smartphone market, or even to the launch of the original Macs to compete with PCs.\nIt has happened so many times that it can no longer be viewed as a problem but rather as a deliberate strategy. Why not let others innovate and wait until the glitches and security problems become apparent before stepping in? Why not wait until consumers have expressed their preferences for improvements to what is available?\nConventional wisdom holds that once a brand is established in a consumer product, the “first mover” advantage is substantial, but in the case of Apple it doesn’t apply, mainly for one good reason. Everything we do these days seems to flow through our phones, and the iPhone dominates the smart phone market almost to the point of ubiquity. The prospect of seamless integration of any home speaker system with the computers in our pockets is an enormous advantage for Apple, and one that will make the HomePod a success, late entry notwithstanding.\nSo, what should potential or existing investors do? It will probably pay to wait for a while. There will almost inevitably be an initial period of negativity among reviewers and users. Those that find fault will be motivated to comment, while the vast majority of users who integrate the HomePod into their daily lives will remain silent. That is just a product of human nature, but the negative vibes will, if history is any guide, hold AAPL back.\nThat will be the time to buy the stock, whether as a short-term trade or to add to existing holdings, because eventually, as with all the other products, the real story will become clear after a few months of sales. The HomePod is neither groundbreaking nor particularly innovative, but it will probably follow the pattern of other Apple products and add to the company’s massive revenue and profits. So, Apple-haters and doubters, bring on the negativity. That way, the rest of us can buy the stock at a discount.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

         "ALGN",
         "Investors in Align Technology Inc (Symbol: ALGN) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 16th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ALGN options chain for the new March 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\nThe put contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of 65 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $190.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $189.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ALGN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $274.25/share today.\nBecause the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 31% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.34% return on the cash commitment, or 2.50% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Align Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $190.00 strike is located relative to that history:\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $280.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of ALGN stock at the current price level of $274.25/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $280.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.87% if the stock gets called away at the March 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ALGN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Align Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ALGN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $280.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.78% boost of extra return to the investor, or 34.90% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 73%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 41%.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $274.25) to be 34%.

         "10 Value Stocks to Buy for 2018 and Beyond",
         "ALK",
         "The stock market was unkind to Warren Buffett disciples in 2017. Value investors missed out as their \"cheap\" stocks lagged growth miserably - by as many as 16 percentage points depending on the yardstick.\nBut that's going to change in 2018. It's shaping up to be the year Buffett's minions may finally rejoice. \"Value will have its day in the sun,\" predicts John Buckingham, a veteran value investor and chief investment officer at AFAM Capital Asset Management.\nHere are five reasons why - followed by 10 value stocks to buy for 2018 and beyond.\nWhat goes around comes around. A basic investing rule is that unusual aberrations tend to vanish in time. Known as \"reversion to the mean,\" this rule suggests value could do well. The reason: Because growth trounced value last year, the valuation gap between the two is wider than it's been since 2000. \"Outperformance by growth is long in the tooth,\" says Todd Lowenstein, director of research at HighMark Capital Management. \"This will mean-revert.\"\nHistory favors value. One reason Buffett does so well is he's in the right neighborhood. Value vastly outperforms growth. Since 1927, value has posted 13.3% annualized gains vs. 9.3% for growth, points out Buckingham, who pens the Prudent Speculator stock letter, which gets high marks from Hulbert Financial Digest. Being in value means you have a tailwind - sooner or later.\nThe FANGs may fall. In 2017, investors fell in love with Facebook ( FB ), Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ). Now they look pricey. The love affair looks ominous because it resembles investor infatuation with highflying tech names in 2000, Buckingham says. Since then, value has trounced growth, posting 7.2% annualized gains vs. 4.2%.\nConditions are ripe. Beaten-down value stocks are lean and mean. They have low debt. So as the rising tide of stepped up economic growth lifts all boats, more of their newfound revenue will fall to the bottom line, says Brad Evans, who manages Heartland Value Plus ( HRVIX ). Value also outperforms during times of rising interest rates.\nValue may be \"safer.\" If the market finally does pull back, value names may be \"safer\" since their multiples are already compressed. This means you're less likely to get shaken out by a scary selloff. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index trades for around 20 times forward earnings while the S&P 500 Pure Value Index goes for 14.3 times.\nHere are 10 value stocks to buy for \"the year of value\":\nSEE ALSO: 18 Best Stocks to Buy for 2018\nDividend yield: 2.6%\nGilead Sciences ( GILD , $79.06) is a good example of how too much success can be bad for a biotech company. Unlike many drugs, Gilead's blockbuster Sovaldi and Harvoni effectively cure patients with hepatitis C so they don't have to keep dosing. The problem: Once Gilead has treated enough hep C patients, there are fewer left to take the drugs. This dynamic, plus competition from AbbVie ( ABBV ) and Merck ( MRK ), means Gilead's hep C therapy revenue growth has vanished.\nThe hep C \"problem\" combined with investor concerns about crackdowns on drug pricing helps explain why this once hot growth name has turned into a favorite value stock of Albert Meyer, who runs Bastiat Capital. Meyer is worth listening to because he trounces the S&P 500. His accounts are up 176.5% since April 2006 inception compared to 104% for the S&P 500.\nWhat might turn things around for Gilead, which trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.6? The company recently purchased a pioneering cancer treatment company called Kite Pharma. Its CAR T-cell genetic engineering therapy is poised for takeoff. Gilead has a strong portfolio of HIV therapies, and it is launching more. It also has a pipeline of immunology and liver disease drugs.\nMeanwhile, despite its growth slowdown, Gilead still is incredibly profitable, Meyer says. And it pays investors a dividend yield of 2.6% while they wait for the biotech company to turn around.\nSEE ALSO: 11 Best Health Care Stocks to Buy\nDividend yield: 3.7%\nInternational Business Machines ( IBM , $164.20) has the blues. The stock has gone virtually nowhere in the past year, in a strong market. \"It is probably the most hated stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average other than General Electric,\" says Steven Check, a value investor at Check Capital Management, which has $1.5 billion under management. IBM has a forward price earnings ratio of less than 12, compared to 23 for Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nOf course, hated names often are the ones most loved by value investors. IBM is a great example. Check counts it among his holdings in managed accounts and at his Blue Chip Investor Fund ( BCIFX ), which has outperformed its category by 2 percentage points a year, annualized, over the past three years. AFAM's Buckingham also likes Big Blue.\nIBM may be in old-school mainframe computers. But that's not so bad. They still play a big role inside many companies because they're reliable and secure. IBM recently rolled out a new version, the z14, and sales are picking up. IBM's core mainframe business serves as a source of stability and funding for its \"strategic Imperatives,\" like analytics and cloud computing.\n\"It isn't going to take too much in the way of good news for this stock to finally react,\" Check says. A shift in investor sentiment could work wonders. Check points out that Microsoft shares have more than doubled in the past three years, even though earnings have barely budged from 2013-14 levels - thanks to a sentiment shift alone. Meanwhile, because of IBM's core strengths, the downside is limited.\n\"IBM is not going away,\" Check says. \"Limit the downside, and the upside will take care of itself, eventually.\"\nSEE ALSO: 50 Dividend Stocks You Can Count On in 2018\nDividend yield: 1.2%\nComing out of the financial crisis when everyone hated Wall Street, Goldman Sachs ( GS , $255.13) was described as a \"great vampire squid ... relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money\" by Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi.\nThe moniker stuck. But it turns out Goldman was more of a vampire plankton. While colorfully described, the bank's supposedly domineering presence hasn't helped much. Goldman's stock is up only 62% since Rolling Stone introduced the squid metaphor in early April 2010, compared to 169% gains for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) exchange-traded fund (both include dividends).\nThis reminds us that the media regularly serve as a source of great contrarian signals. Beyond that lesson, Goldman confirms that quality companies lagging the markets by huge amounts often are targets of value investors. Goldman's weakness is one reason Meyer, at Bastiat Capital, owns the bank for clients. The stock trades well below the market multiple. It has a forward price earnings ratio of 12, Meyer says.\nWhat could go right? Goldman should benefit from ongoing deregulation in the U.S. and strong, synchronized global growth. Goldman gets about 40% of its revenue from abroad. It has been cutting costs and buying back stock. Meanwhile, it can repatriate more than $25 billion, which it could use to support more share buybacks or a dividend hike, Meyer says.\nSEE ALSO: 5 Bank Stocks to Love in This \"Goldilocks\" Economy\nDividend yield: 2.5%\nFabled General Electric ( GE , $19.02) has a reputation as a top management training ground that spawns great leaders. They go on to guide other companies to greatness once it's clear they aren't getting the CEO slot at GE.\nBut something went wrong with Jeffrey Immelt, a General Electric alum who won the CEO job in 2000. Either he got dealt a bad hand by being on the job during the financial crisis. Or he simply tried to do too much. Whatever the reason, his tenure - which ended in October 2017 - was a disaster. The stock is lower than it was when he took the helm. And it is down 40% in the past year.\nBut there's a silver lining to the story: These kinds of declines are a value investor's dream. Many have stepped in to buy the stock amid the current weakness. \"Long term, it is going to be a decent investment,\" says Bob Bacarella, co-manager of Monetta Young Investor Fund ( MYIFX ).\nNew CEO John Flannery, who took over last summer, is managing a restructuring, including selling off non-core assets and cutting costs. He has been buying GE stock , a bullish sign. A big positive for investors is that about 70% of General Electric's sales come from business where the company dominates the market, meaning aviation, power and healthcare, points out George Putnam, who recently suggested the stock in his Turnaround Letter.\n\"I think GE has good long-term fundamentals, and the new CEO is taking the right steps to clean house and set the stage for the stock to do well,\" he says.\nSEE ALSO: 10 Stocks That Could Replace GE in the Dow\nDividend yield: 1.7%\nUnlike competitors Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) and American Airlines ( AAL ) which are soaring near 52-week highs, shares of Alaska Air Group ( ALK , $74.81) are flying low - at least relative to where they were last winter. The stock is down 20% over the past 52 weeks.\nWhat's the problem? \"It's in the penalty box because of the Virgin America acquisition,\" says AFAM's Buckingham, who also manages the Al Frank Fund ( VALUX ). Alaska Air picked up the competitor in late 2016. Some analysts question whether it makes sense to kill off the Virgin brand, which Alaska Air plans to do in late 2019 to avoid licensing fees.\nBut the merger gives Alaska Air greater access to the California market and valuable East Coast airport gates. \"We think the merger will be a positive,\" Buckingham says. \"It's one of the best-run airlines, and it has great routes. The combination of low fares and a top-level customer experience will continue to be the recipe for Alaska Air's long-term success.\"\nAn added bonus: Alaska Air pays a tax rate in the mid-30% range. So it will get a big boost from tax reform, which lowers the corporate rate to 21%. Alaska Airlines trades for a little more than 11 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 12.6, Buckingham says.\nSEE ALSO: The 10 Best Stocks for GOP Tax Cuts\nDividend yield: 1.0%\nDespite the big gains in the shares of Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOXA , $36.20) since Walt Disney ( DIS ) announced plans to purchase its entertainment assets in December, the media giant still looks undervalued, maintains HighMark's Lowenstein.\nIn the deal, Disney will get 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox's television studios, Fox Sports, regional U.S. sports networks, international cable networks and Fox's 30% stake in Hulu, the online TV platform. FOXA shareholders will get about 25% of the new Disney. And they will be left with a collection of Fox broadcast assets, like its news channels. \"The remaining company is an interesting collection of unique assets that look mispriced,\" Lowenstein says.\nThe broadcast assets are probably worth $9 to $12 per share. But the implied valuation of these assets in the deal - basically Twenty-First Century Fox's market cap minus the value of Disney shares they will get - is $4.50 a share. \"It looks like a mispriced asset,\" Lowenstein says. \"It looks like it is trading at 50 cents on the dollar.\"\nThe risk here is that the Disney-Fox deal fails to go through. But Lowenstein thinks it will.\nSEE ALSO: 15 Great ETFs for a Prosperous 2018\nDividend yield: 2.8%\nPeople are funny about their underwear. They don't like to change them - the brand, that is. Once they find a brand that fits and feels right, they tend to stick with it. That loyalty works in favor of Hanesbrands ( HBI , $22.34).\nIt also should help investors who take advantage of the current weakness in Hanesbrands stock to establish positions. HBI shares have been weak for reasons that won't last forever. Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ) have been reducing inventory, which slowed sales growth at Hanesbrands, says Check, whose Check Capital Management owns the stock. \"That has probably played itself out by now,\" he says.\nThen there's the shift in retails sales to online venues like Amazon.com ( AMZN ). That's not really a problem for Hanesbrands, though. Thanks to the loyalty consumers have to the Hanes, Champion and Maidenform brands, the company can just sell skivvies, bras and socks on Amazon. \"There is nothing wrong with the brand or market share, and the stock trades at a P/E of around 10,\" Check says. \"The slight sales growth decline spooked everyone.\"\nBehind the scenes, the company has a huge advantage. Hanesbrands owns a big global supply chain with plants in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. This means its costs are 15%-20% below those of competitors.\nSEE ALSO: 5 Investment Strategies That Could Shine in 2018\nDividend yield: N/A\nLiberty Interactive ( QVCA , $26.65) is media mogul John Malone's tracking stock for the QVC and HSN home shopping networks. (Tracking stocks represent the value of an underlying business without giving investors a claim on any of the assets.)\nIn a pricey stock market, Liberty Interactive looks cheap because it has a very high free cash flow yield, HighMark's Lowenstein says. Free cash flow yield is free cash flow, or operating cash flow, divided by market cap. So the lower market cap is relative to operating cash flow, the cheaper the stock. QVCA trades for about a 10% free cash flow yield, compared to 4.5% for the S&P 500.\nWhy is the company trading so cheap? \"It is considered a dinosaur business in terminal decline,\" Lowenstein says. \"But we think it's a quality business with a loyal customer base.\" He sees three catalysts. First, QVC recently merged with its biggest competitor, HSN, so there should be cost savings. Next, the company is converting the tracking shares into normal shares, which should reduce the natural discount that tracking stocks carry.\nFinally, Liberty has been holding off on stock buybacks because of the HSN transaction. But the deal closed in December, so buybacks should resume. \"In a stock market that is very expensive, this is a cheap stock with catalysts,\" Lowenstein says.\nSEE ALSO: Our Favorite Dividend-Paying Stocks\nDividend yield: 2%\nNo roundup of value stocks for 2018 would be complete without a few small-cap names. Not only do they suffer from the 2017 value curse, they've been held back by a market cap headwind. Small-cap stocks have been lagging, too.\nThese challenges could fade for several reasons. Small-cap companies pay higher taxes - in part because they can't afford the army of tax lawyers funded by big companies, and in part because they generate more of their revenues domestically. So they will benefit more from the corporate tax cuts. Also, since many large caps appear fully valued, investors may start hunting among smaller names for cheaper stocks. Finally, small-cap companies tend to be leaner and meaner. This means they benefit more from inflation, since more of any price increases fall to the bottom line.\nAll these trends may help Schnitzer Steel Industries ( SCHN , $38.70), a leader in scrap metal dealing. Schnitzer collects, processes and sells huge amounts of metal, primarily steel. The company cut costs and paid down debt during a 2014-16 steel sector slump, so now that the sector is recovering, Schnitzer stands to benefit.\n\"The end markets have entered into fairly robust recovery,\" says Evans, at the Heartland Value Plus Fund, which owns this stock. He thinks annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization could return to $200 million to $250 million, from recent levels of $150 million. If so, that could send Schnitzer Steel's stock up to $50 from the high $30s, based on historical valuation metrics.\nSEE ALSO: 7 Energy Stocks to Buy for Dividends\nDividend yield: 3.6%\nPowell Industries ( POWL , $29.88) - which makes switchgear and other products regulating power used by huge oil and gas refining plants, petrochemical producers, railroads and utilities - is another small-cap name that may outperform, Evans says.\nIts stock sure looks cheap. Shares trade at just above tangible book value, compared to a multiple of 1.7 times over the past 10 years, Evans says. That's the kind of discount that grabs a value investor's attention.\nWhy so cheap? Evans says it's because of the scant sell-side analyst coverage. Plus, many of the company's customers are in the energy sector, which has been weak. But things are looking up there, as oil prices continue to rise, and that should help Powell. \"The end markets are beginning to recover,\" he says.\nMeanwhile, the company has another quality value investors love to see - solid financial strength. The company has solid free cash flow and $11 a share in cash, Evans says, or about a third of its stock price. This suggests Powell's 3.6% dividend yield is secure.\nMichael Brush has suggested FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL, GILD, IBM, GS and GE in his stock newsletter Brush Up on Stocks .
