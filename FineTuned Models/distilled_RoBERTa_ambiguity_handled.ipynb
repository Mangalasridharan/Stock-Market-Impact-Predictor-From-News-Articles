Further, earnings grew 4% year over year and came in above management's guided range of 99 cents to $1.04 per share.\\nUpbeat Q3 Guidance: The company projects earnings per share for the third quarter at 90-95 cents, excluding any restructuring expenses and effects associated with the CSP Technologies acquisition. The guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 11% at the mid-point. AptarGroup expects its core sales to grow in each segment in the third quarter.

AptarGroup is poised to gain from its focus on the plan which is likely to yield annual recurring incremental EBITDA of approximately $80 million by the end of 2020.\\nAcquisitions Remain a Catalyst: AptarGroup remains committed to its strategy of expanding business through inorganic growth. In sync with this, the company has made a binding offer to acquire CSP Technologies, a leader in active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise, for an enterprise value of $555 million.

Watkins.\\nIn its Pharma segment, its preservative-free, multi-dose Ophthalmic Squeeze Dispenser was announced as the approved delivery device for Bausch+ Lomb's prescription LevofreeMultidose in France.

In the injectables market, the company launched a muscle relaxer in Mexico, and a pain reliever and aesthetic products in North America. In Food + Beverage segment, its Flow Control silicone valve is performing very well. Further, Daisy continues to grow with their inverted Squeeze Sour Cream product and recently introduced a new light version using custom dispensing closure with valve technology.\\nReturn on Assets (ROA): AptarGroup currently has a ROA of 7.4%, while the industry's ROA is 5.7%.

And that makes finding breakout stocks to buy an easy feat. Today\\u2019s gallery will feature three such candidates for your consideration.\\nThe S&P 500 ended Friday 1.3% from all-time highs. The Dow was 1.5% from record territory, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was already basking in new highs. With the bullishness of the market backdrop, an increasingly high number of stocks are returning to last year\\u2019s glory days.\\nTraders are fond of the so-called \\u201cbullish breakout\\u201d pattern because it presents an attractive low-risk entry to climb aboard uptrending stocks. When resistance gives way, old bears run for cover and new bulls swarm. Together, this creates a demand surge that can result in substantial upside follow through.\\nI\\u2019ve scanned the market and found a handful of breakout stocks to buy. Take a look.\\nSource: ThinkorSwim\\nAmerican Express (AXP)\\nThe breakout setup in American Express (NYSE:) is particularly potent due to last week\\u2019s earnings release. The numbers were good, and buyers flocked, driving the credit card giant to the cusp of record highs. On the price trend front, bulls control all time frames. The 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages are all heading northbound.\\nThursday\\u2019s volume surge adds legitimacy to the rally, showing institutions are lending their support to the breakout bid. Though equities are weak this morning, AXP stock\\u2019s down-gap is being quickly bought up. Throw it all together, and I suspect a breach of the $114.50 resistance zone is only a matter of time.\\nTo capitalize, buy the June $115/$120 bull call spread for $1.32. The risk is limited to the original cost, and the reward is $3.68.\\nSource: ThinkorSwim\\nAlibaba Group (BABA)\\nChinese stocks are pulling the emerging markets space higher this year. And that has led to some lucrative bullish plays in a few of its more popular companies including Alibaba Group (NYSE:). Unfortunately, overhead resistance has conspired to end the internet giant\\u2019s recovery attempts, resulting in six weeks of churn. Multiple attempts to breach $190 have failed, but I think buyers still stand a chance.\\nThe bullish backdrop in stocks coupled with BABA stock\\u2019s uptrend still being intact lead me to continue to root for buyers. Fortunately, there\\u2019s no need to speculate. Instead, we can simply wait for confirmation that resistance has finally given way and then deploy bullish trades.\\nIf BABA stock trade above $190, then buy bull call spreads. The June $190/$200 should do the trick. Your risk will be limited to the trade cost.\\nSource: ThinkorSwim\\nCostco Wholesale (COST)\\nSpurred by a rousing earnings announcement in March, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:) shares have been on the rise. The rally was strong enough to vault above last year\\u2019s peak to new record territory. Moving averages are rising across all-time frames and should embolden buyers.\\nOver the past two weeks, we\\u2019ve seen resistance form near $247. The pause is more than justified because COST stock had become quite overbought. Consolidation allows the stretched conditions to ease and new, lower-risk entry points to emerge.\\nWhile COST stock may need a bit more basing before breaking out, the time to prep trades is now. When COST rises above $247.25, consider buying the June $250/$260 bull call spread.\\nAs of this writing, Tyler Craig didn\\u2019t hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The company is a global provider of consumer product dispensing systems catering to beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food and beverage markets. Its shares gained 26% in a year's time, outperforming the industry 's growth of 3%. Lets' delve deep into what is driving the stock and makes it an intriguing choice for investors right now. Better-than-expected Q2: AptarGroup delivered second-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.09, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01. Further, earnings grew 4% year over year and came in above management's guided range of 99 cents to $1.04 per share. Upbeat Q3 Guidance: The company projects earnings per share for the third quarter at 90-95 cents, excluding any restructuring expenses and effects associated with the CSP Technologies acquisition. The guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 11% at the mid-point. AptarGroup expects its core sales to grow in each segment in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is at 93 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12%. Transformation Plan to Aid Results: In late 2017, AptarGroup began a business-transformation plan in a bid to become a more agile, competitive and customer-centric business. This plan includes a wide range of initiatives to drive sales growth, enhance operational excellence along with improving organizational health and effectiveness. [AMBIGUOUS] AptarGroup is poised to gain from its focus on the plan which is likely to yield annual recurring incremental EBITDA of approximately $80 million by the end of 2020. Acquisitions Remain a Catalyst: AptarGroup remains committed to its strategy of expanding business through inorganic growth. In sync with this, the company has made a binding offer to acquire CSP Technologies, a leader in active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise, for an enterprise value of $555 million. [AMBIGUOUS] The buyout will help AptarGroup bolster its existing business in the Pharma and Food Safety markets considering that CSP Technologies' current business is roughly 75% in the pharma market and 25% in the food safety market. Further, the company acquired 100% of the common stock of Reboul, a French manufacturer specializing in stamping, decorating and assembling metal and plastic packaging for the cosmetics and luxury markets, for approximately $3.6 million. New Product Rollouts to Boost Revenues: AptarGroup is well poised to gain from product launches. In the Beauty + Home segment, it provided LVMH with customized dispensing solution for double serum facial skin care product in Europe. In personal care, the company designed a custom pump for Johnson & Johnson's major global relaunch of their iconic baby care line, ranging from shampoo to bubble bath to lotion. In home care, AptarGroup's Fine Mist pump, with prolonged spray technology, is featured on a room refresher spray by J.R. Watkins. In its Pharma segment, its preservative-free, multi-dose Ophthalmic Squeeze Dispenser was announced as the approved delivery device for Bausch+ Lomb's prescription LevofreeMultidose in France. In consumer health care, its Advanced Preservative Free Plus pump for eye care is found on a new dry eye mist by Similasan in the CVS store brand in the United States. In the injectables market, the company launched a muscle relaxer in Mexico, and a pain reliever and aesthetic products in North America. In Food + Beverage segment, its Flow Control silicone valve is performing very well. Further, Daisy continues to grow with their inverted Squeeze Sour Cream product and recently introduced a new light version using custom dispensing closure with valve technology. Return on Assets (ROA): AptarGroup currently has a ROA of 7.4%, while the industry's ROA is 5.7%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Positive Earnings Surprise History: AptarGroup has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.05%. Growth Projections: Estimates for AptarGroup have been revised upward over the past 30 days, reflecting the brokers' confidence in the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 being moved north by 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $3.89, representing year-over-year increase of 13%. For 2019, the consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $4.27, translating into a year-over-year rise of 9.80%. The expected long-term earnings growth is pegged at 8.5%. In light of these positives, we believe investors should retain AptarGroup stock for now. The stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Zacks VGM Score of B seems to suggest the same.

[ORG]\",\n          \"Stocks are opening the week [DATE] with record highs in sight. And that makes finding breakout stocks to buy an easy feat. Today [DATE]\\u2019s gallery will feature three [CARDINAL] such candidates for your consideration. The S&P 500 ended Friday 1.3% [PERCENT] from all-time highs. The Dow [ORG] was 1.5% [PERCENT] from record territory, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq [ORG] was already basking in new highs. With the bullishness of the market backdrop, an increasingly high number of stocks are returning to last year\\u2019s glory days [DATE]. Traders are fond of the so-called \\u201cbullish breakout\\u201d pattern because it presents an attractive low-risk entry to climb aboard uptrending stocks. When resistance gives way, old bears run for cover and new bulls swarm. Together, this creates a demand surge that can result in substantial upside follow through. I\\u2019ve scanned the market and found a handful of breakout stocks to buy. Take a look. Source: ThinkorSwim [ORG]\\nAmerican Express [ORG] (AXP)\\nThe breakout setup in American Express [ORG] (NYSE [ORG]:) is particularly potent due to last week [DATE]\\u2019s earnings release. The numbers were good, and buyers flocked, driving the credit card giant to the cusp of record highs. On the price trend front, bulls control all time frames. The 20-day [DATE], 50-day [DATE], and 200-day [DATE] moving averages are all heading northbound. Thursday [DATE]\\u2019s volume surge adds legitimacy to the rally, showing institutions are lending their support to the breakout bid. Though equities are weak this morning [TIME], AXP stock\\u2019s down-gap is being quickly bought up. Throw it all together, and I suspect a breach of the $114.50 [MONEY] resistance zone is only a matter of time. To capitalize, buy the June [DATE] $115/$120 [MONEY] bull call spread for $1.32 [MONEY]. [AMBIGUOUS] The risk is limited to the original cost, and the reward is $3.68 [MONEY]. Source: ThinkorSwim [ORG]\\nAlibaba Group [ORG] (BABA)\\nChinese [NORP] stocks are pulling the emerging markets space higher this year [DATE]. And that has led to some lucrative bullish plays in a few of its more popular companies including Alibaba Group [ORG] (NYSE [ORG]:). Unfortunately, overhead resistance has conspired to end the internet giant\\u2019s recovery attempts, resulting in six weeks [DATE] of churn. Multiple attempts to breach $190 [MONEY] have failed, but I think buyers still stand a chance. The bullish backdrop in stocks coupled with BABA stock\\u2019s uptrend still being intact lead me to continue to root for buyers. Fortunately, there\\u2019s no need to speculate. Instead, we can simply wait for confirmation that resistance has finally given way and then deploy bullish trades. If BABA stock trade above $190 [MONEY], then buy bull call spreads. The June [DATE] $190/$200 [MONEY] should do the trick. [AMBIGUOUS] Your risk will be limited to the trade cost. Source: ThinkorSwim [ORG]\\nCostco Wholesale [PERSON] (COST)\\nSpurred by a rousing earnings announcement in March [DATE], Costco Wholesale [PERSON] (NASDAQ [ORG]:) shares have been on the rise. The rally was strong enough to vault above last year [DATE]\\u2019s peak to new record territory. Moving averages are rising across all-time frames and should embolden buyers. Over the past two weeks [DATE], we\\u2019ve seen resistance form near $247 [MONEY]. The pause is more than justified because COST stock had become quite overbought. Consolidation allows the stretched conditions to ease and new, lower-risk entry points to emerge. While COST stock may need a bit more basing before breaking out, the time to prep trades is now. When COST rises above $247.25 [MONEY], consider buying the June [DATE] $250/$260 [MONEY] bull call spread.

Its shares gained 26% in a year's time, outperforming the industry 's growth of 3%.\\nLets' delve deep into what is driving the stock and makes it an intriguing choice for investors right now.\\nBetter-than-expected Q2: AptarGroup delivered second-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.09, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01. Further, earnings grew 4% year over year and came in above management's guided range of 99 cents to $1.04 per share.\\nUpbeat Q3 Guidance: The company projects earnings per share for the third quarter at 90-95 cents, excluding any restructuring expenses and effects associated with the CSP Technologies acquisition. The guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 11% at the mid-point. AptarGroup expects its core sales to grow in each segment in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is at 93 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12%.\\nTransformation Plan to Aid Results: In late 2017, AptarGroup began a business-transformation plan in a bid to become a more agile, competitive and customer-centric business. This plan includes a wide range of initiatives to drive sales growth, enhance operational excellence along with improving organizational health and effectiveness. AptarGroup is poised to gain from its focus on the plan which is likely to yield annual recurring incremental EBITDA of approximately $80 million by the end of 2020.\\nAcquisitions Remain a Catalyst: AptarGroup remains committed to its strategy of expanding business through inorganic growth. In sync with this, the company has made a binding offer to acquire CSP Technologies, a leader in active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise, for an enterprise value of $555 million. The buyout will help AptarGroup bolster its existing business in the Pharma and Food Safety markets considering that CSP Technologies' current business is roughly 75% in the pharma market and 25% in the food safety market. Further, the company acquired 100% of the common stock of Reboul, a French manufacturer specializing in stamping, decorating and assembling metal and plastic packaging for the cosmetics and luxury markets, for approximately $3.6 million.\\nNew Product Rollouts to Boost Revenues: AptarGroup is well poised to gain from product launches. In the Beauty + Home segment, it provided LVMH with customized dispensing solution for double serum facial skin care product in Europe. In personal care, the company designed a custom pump for Johnson & Johnson's major global relaunch of their iconic baby care line, ranging from shampoo to bubble bath to lotion. In home care, AptarGroup's Fine Mist pump, with prolonged spray technology, is featured on a room refresher spray by J.R. Watkins.\\nIn its Pharma segment, its preservative-free, multi-dose Ophthalmic Squeeze Dispenser was announced as the approved delivery device for Bausch+ Lomb's prescription LevofreeMultidose in France. In consumer health care, its Advanced Preservative Free Plus pump for eye care is found on a new dry eye mist by Similasan in the CVS store brand in the United States. In the injectables market, the company launched a muscle relaxer in Mexico, and a pain reliever and aesthetic products in North America. In Food + Beverage segment, its Flow Control silicone valve is performing very well. Further, Daisy continues to grow with their inverted Squeeze Sour Cream product and recently introduced a new light version using custom dispensing closure with valve technology.\\nReturn on Assets (ROA): AptarGroup currently has a ROA of 7.4%, while the industry's ROA is 5.7%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets.\\nPositive Earnings Surprise History: AptarGroup has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.05%.\\nGrowth Projections: Estimates for AptarGroup have been revised upward over the past 30 days, reflecting the brokers' confidence in the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 being moved north by 3%.\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $3.89, representing year-over-year increase of 13%. For 2019, the consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $4.27, translating into a year-over-year rise of 9.80%.\\nThe expected long-term earnings growth is pegged at 8.5%.\\nIn light of these positives, we believe investors should retain AptarGroup stock for now.

And that makes finding breakout stocks to buy an easy feat. Today\\u2019s gallery will feature three such candidates for your consideration.\\nThe S&P 500 ended Friday 1.3% from all-time highs. The Dow was 1.5% from record territory, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was already basking in new highs. With the bullishness of the market backdrop, an increasingly high number of stocks are returning to last year\\u2019s glory days.\\nTraders are fond of the so-called \\u201cbullish breakout\\u201d pattern because it presents an attractive low-risk entry to climb aboard uptrending stocks. When resistance gives way, old bears run for cover and new bulls swarm. Together, this creates a demand surge that can result in substantial upside follow through.\\nI\\u2019ve scanned the market and found a handful of breakout stocks to buy. Take a look.\\nSource: ThinkorSwim\\nAmerican Express (AXP)\\nThe breakout setup in American Express (NYSE:) is particularly potent due to last week\\u2019s earnings release. The numbers were good, and buyers flocked, driving the credit card giant to the cusp of record highs. On the price trend front, bulls control all time frames. The 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages are all heading northbound.\\nThursday\\u2019s volume surge adds legitimacy to the rally, showing institutions are lending their support to the breakout bid. Though equities are weak this morning, AXP stock\\u2019s down-gap is being quickly bought up. Throw it all together, and I suspect a breach of the $114.50 resistance zone is only a matter of time.\\nTo capitalize, buy the June $115/$120 bull call spread for $1.32. The risk is limited to the original cost, and the reward is $3.68.\\nSource: ThinkorSwim\\nAlibaba Group (BABA)\\nChinese stocks are pulling the emerging markets space higher this year. And that has led to some lucrative bullish plays in a few of its more popular companies including Alibaba Group (NYSE:). Unfortunately, overhead resistance has conspired to end the internet giant\\u2019s recovery attempts, resulting in six weeks of churn. Multiple attempts to breach $190 have failed, but I think buyers still stand a chance.\\nThe bullish backdrop in stocks coupled with BABA stock\\u2019s uptrend still being intact lead me to continue to root for buyers. Fortunately, there\\u2019s no need to speculate. Instead, we can simply wait for confirmation that resistance has finally given way and then deploy bullish trades.\\nIf BABA stock trade above $190, then buy bull call spreads. The June $190/$200 should do the trick. Your risk will be limited to the trade cost.\\nSource: ThinkorSwim\\nCostco Wholesale (COST)\\nSpurred by a rousing earnings announcement in March, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:) shares have been on the rise. The rally was strong enough to vault above last year\\u2019s peak to new record territory. Moving averages are rising across all-time frames and should embolden buyers.\\nOver the past two weeks, we\\u2019ve seen resistance form near $247. The pause is more than justified because COST stock had become quite overbought. Consolidation allows the stretched conditions to ease and new, lower-risk entry points to emerge.\\nWhile COST stock may need a bit more basing before breaking out, the time to prep trades is now. When COST rises above $247.25, consider buying the June $250/$260 bull call spread.\\nAs of this writing, Tyler Craig didn\\u2019t hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

[ORG]\",\n          \"AptarGroup, Inc.ATR [ORG] remains well poised to gain from its business-transformation plan, product roll outs, focus on improving operations and acquisitions. The company is a global provider of consumer product dispensing systems catering to beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food and beverage markets. Its shares gained 26% [PERCENT] in a year [DATE]'s time, outperforming the industry 's growth of 3% [PERCENT]. Lets' delve deep into what is driving the stock and makes it an intriguing choice for investors right now.

This plan includes a wide range of initiatives to drive sales growth, enhance operational excellence along with improving organizational health and effectiveness. [AMBIGUOUS] AptarGroup [ORG] is poised to gain from its focus on the plan which is likely to yield annual [DATE] recurring incremental EBITDA of approximately $80 million [MONEY] by the end of 2020 [DATE]. Acquisitions Remain a Catalyst: AptarGroup remains committed to its strategy of expanding business through inorganic growth. In sync with this, the company has made a binding offer to acquire CSP Technologies [ORG], a leader in active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise, for an enterprise value of $555 million [MONEY]. [AMBIGUOUS] The buyout will help AptarGroup [ORG] bolster its existing business in the Pharma and Food Safety markets considering that CSP Technologies' [ORG] current business is roughly 75% [PERCENT] in the pharma market and 25% [PERCENT] in the food safety market. Further, the company acquired 100% [PERCENT] of the common stock of Reboul [GPE], a French [NORP] manufacturer specializing in stamping, decorating and assembling metal and plastic packaging for the cosmetics and luxury markets, for approximately $3.6 million [MONEY]. New Product Rollouts to Boost Revenues: AptarGroup is well poised to gain from product launches. In the Beauty + Home segment, it provided LVMH with customized dispensing solution for double serum facial skin care product in Europe [LOC]. In personal care, the company designed a custom pump for Johnson & Johnson's [ORG] major global relaunch of their iconic baby care line, ranging from shampoo to bubble bath to lotion. In home care, AptarGroup [ORG]'s Fine Mist pump, with prolonged spray technology, is featured on a room refresher spray by J.R. Watkins [PERSON]. In its Pharma [NORP] segment, its preservative-free, multi-dose Ophthalmic Squeeze Dispenser was announced as the approved delivery device for Bausch+ Lomb [PERSON]'s prescription LevofreeMultidose in France [GPE]. In consumer health care, its Advanced Preservative Free Plus [ORG] pump for eye care is found on a new dry eye mist by Similasan [PERSON] in the CVS [ORG] store brand in the United States [GPE]. In the injectables market, the company launched a muscle relaxer in Mexico [GPE], and a pain reliever and aesthetic products in North America [LOC]. In Food + Beverage [LOC] segment, its Flow Control [ORG] silicone valve is performing very well. Further, Daisy [PERSON] continues to grow with their inverted Squeeze Sour Cream product and recently introduced a new light version using custom dispensing closure with valve technology. Return on Assets (ROA): AptarGroup [ORG] currently has a ROA of 7.4% [PERCENT], while the industry's ROA [ORG] is 5.7% [PERCENT]. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Positive Earnings Surprise History: AptarGroup [ORG] has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters [DATE], delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.05% [PERCENT]. Growth Projections: Estimates for AptarGroup [ORG] have been revised upward over the past 30 days [DATE], reflecting the brokers' confidence in the stock.

[ORG]\",\n          \"Stocks are opening the week [DATE] with record highs in sight. And that makes finding breakout stocks to buy an easy feat. Today [DATE]\\u2019s gallery will feature three [CARDINAL] such candidates for your consideration. The S&P 500 ended Friday 1.3% [PERCENT] from all-time highs. The Dow [ORG] was 1.5% [PERCENT] from record territory, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq [ORG] was already basking in new highs. With the bullishness of the market backdrop, an increasingly high number of stocks are returning to last year\\u2019s glory days [DATE]. Traders are fond of the so-called \\u201cbullish breakout\\u201d pattern because it presents an attractive low-risk entry to climb aboard uptrending stocks. When resistance gives way, old bears run for cover and new bulls swarm. Together, this creates a demand surge that can result in substantial upside follow through. I\\u2019ve scanned the market and found a handful of breakout stocks to buy. Take a look. Source: ThinkorSwim [ORG]\\nAmerican Express [ORG] (AXP)\\nThe breakout setup in American Express [ORG] (NYSE [ORG]:) is particularly potent due to last week [DATE]\\u2019s earnings release. The numbers were good, and buyers flocked, driving the credit card giant to the cusp of record highs. On the price trend front, bulls control all time frames. The 20-day [DATE], 50-day [DATE], and 200-day [DATE] moving averages are all heading northbound. Thursday [DATE]\\u2019s volume surge adds legitimacy to the rally, showing institutions are lending their support to the breakout bid. Though equities are weak this morning [TIME], AXP stock\\u2019s down-gap is being quickly bought up. Throw it all together, and I suspect a breach of the $114.50 [MONEY] resistance zone is only a matter of time. To capitalize, buy the June [DATE] $115/$120 [MONEY] bull call spread for $1.32 [MONEY]. [AMBIGUOUS] The risk is limited to the original cost, and the reward is $3.68 [MONEY]. Source: ThinkorSwim [ORG]\\nAlibaba Group [ORG] (BABA)\\nChinese [NORP] stocks are pulling the emerging markets space higher this year [DATE]. And that has led to some lucrative bullish plays in a few of its more popular companies including Alibaba Group [ORG] (NYSE [ORG]:). Unfortunately, overhead resistance has conspired to end the internet giant\\u2019s recovery attempts, resulting in six weeks [DATE] of churn. Multiple attempts to breach $190 [MONEY] have failed, but I think buyers still stand a chance. The bullish backdrop in stocks coupled with BABA stock\\u2019s uptrend still being intact lead me to continue to root for buyers. Fortunately, there\\u2019s no need to speculate. Instead, we can simply wait for confirmation that resistance has finally given way and then deploy bullish trades. If BABA stock trade above $190 [MONEY], then buy bull call spreads. The June [DATE] $190/$200 [MONEY] should do the trick. [AMBIGUOUS] Your risk will be limited to the trade cost. Source: ThinkorSwim [ORG]\\nCostco Wholesale [PERSON] (COST)\\nSpurred by a rousing earnings announcement in March [DATE], Costco Wholesale [PERSON] (NASDAQ [ORG]:) shares have been on the rise. The rally was strong enough to vault above last year [DATE]\\u2019s peak to new record territory. Moving averages are rising across all-time frames and should embolden buyers. Over the past two weeks [DATE], we\\u2019ve seen resistance form near $247 [MONEY]. The pause is more than justified because COST stock had become quite overbought. Consolidation allows the stretched conditions to ease and new, lower-risk entry points to emerge. While COST stock may need a bit more basing before breaking out, the time to prep trades is now. When COST rises above $247.25 [MONEY], consider buying the June [DATE] $250/$260 [MONEY] bull call spread.

[AMBIGUOUS] your risk will be limited to the trade cost. source thinkorswim [ORG] costco wholesale [PERSON] cost spurred by a rousing earnings announcement in march [DATE], costco wholesale [PERSON] nasdaq [ORG] shares have been on the rise. the rally was strong enough to vault above last year [DATE] s peak to new record territory. moving averages are rising across all time frames and should embolden buyers. over the past two weeks [DATE], we ve seen resistance form near $247 [MONEY]. the pause is more than justified because cost stock had become quite overbought. consolidation allows the stretched conditions to ease and new, lower risk entry points to emerge. while cost stock may need a bit more basing before breaking out, the time to prep trades is now. when cost rises above $247.25 [MONEY], consider buying the june [DATE] $250 $260 [MONEY] bull call spread. as of this writing, tyler craig [PERSON] didn t hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. check out his recently released to learn how to defend your portfolio against market volatility. more from investorplace the post appeared first [ORDINAL] on investorplace [ORG]. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq, inc.
