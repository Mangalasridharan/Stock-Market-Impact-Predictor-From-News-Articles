         "Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new August 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\nThe put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.99/share today.\nBecause the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.60% return on the cash commitment, or 5.45% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $138.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.75% if the stock gets called away at the August 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $138.99) to be 27%.

         "Fintel reports that on December 13, 2023, Wolfe Research initiated coverage of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) with a Outperform recommendation.\nAnalyst Price Forecast Suggests 1.04% Downside\nAs of November 27, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 132.34. The forecasts range from a low of 101.00 to a high of $157.50. The average price target represents a decrease of 1.04% from its latest reported closing price of 133.74.\nSee our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.\nThe projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 4.35%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77.\nAgilent Technologies Declares $0.24 Dividend\nOn November 15, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share ($0.94 annualized). Shareholders of record as of January 2, 2024 will receive the payment on January 24, 2024. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share.\nAt the current share price of $133.74 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.71%.\nLooking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.72%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.14 (n=235).\nThe current dividend yield is 0.12 standard deviations below the historical average.\nAdditionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.22. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.\nThe company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.22%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.\nWhat is the Fund Sentiment?\nThere are 1945 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies. This is an increase of 30 owner(s) or 1.57% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to A is 0.31%, a decrease of 2.75%. Total shares owned by institutions increased in the last three months by 1.25% to 300,740K shares.\nThe put/call ratio of A is 1.01, indicating a bearish outlook.\nWhat are Other Shareholders Doing?\nMassachusetts Financial Services holds 11,076K shares representing 3.79% ownership of the company.

         "In recent trading, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $132.36, changing hands for $133.74/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\nThere are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agilent Technologies, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $146.00. The standard deviation is $12.779.\nBut the whole reason to look at the average A price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with A crossing above that average target price of $132.36/share, investors in A have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $132.36 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

         "Agilent Technologies A is enhancing its BioTek product line on the back of portfolio expansions and technology upgrades.\n\nNotably, Agilent enhanced the BioTek Cytation C10 confocal imaging reader with the addition of water immersion and confocal spinning disk technology.\n\nFurther, the water immersion technology can be used in light microscopy to increase numerical aperture, reduce z-axis distortion, and improve image quality by placing water between the objective lens and sample.\n\nAdditionally, the technology aids researchers in reducing exposure times in live-cell applications, thereby reducing the traditional phototoxic effects associated with these experiments.\n\nMoreover, this addition offers a deep-sectioning spinning disk technology, enhancing microscopic images by blocking out-of-focus light, resulting in clearer, more quantitative results.\n\nAgilent is anticipated to gain significant traction among researchers utilizing live-cell and 3D applications on the back of its latest move.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\nGrowth Prospects\nThe latest move positions the company well to strengthen its footing in the global microplate reader and live cell imaging markets.\n\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global microplate reader market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period 2023-2030.\n\nA Mordor Intelligence report indicates the global live cell imaging market size will reach $2.95 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.06% between 2023 and 2028.\n\nWe believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nHowever, the company has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions.\n\nAgilent has lost 13.9% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 0.9%.\nACG Segment in Focus\nThe latest move bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) segment.\n\nNotably, Agilent Technologies launched Gen6 software for all Agilent BioTek detection instruments, offering automated optimization tools and improved navigation through built-in data analysis functions.\n\nFurther, the company introduced the Agilent BioTek 406 FX washer dispenser, a compact tool that combines reagent dispensing and plate-washing, suitable for automated systems and benchtop use.\n\nAll the abovementioned endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the ACG segment in the days ahead.\n\nIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the ACG segment revenues increased 6% year over year to $404 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues.\n\nOur model projects fiscal 2024 ACG segment revenues at $1.64 billion, indicating growth of 4.7% from 2022.\n\nStrong momentum in the underlined segment will likely aid its overall financial performance in the upcoming period.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Badger Meter BMI, Arista Networks ANET and Adobe ADBE. While Badger Meter currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Arista Networks and Adobe carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nShares of Badger Meter have gained 37.8% in the year-to-date period. BMI’s long-term earnings growth rate is currently projected at 20.39%.\n\nShares of Arista Networks have surged 75.9% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for ANET is currently projected at 19.77%.\n\nShares of Adobe have gained 84.3% in the year-to-date period.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Visa Inc. V, Marriott International, Inc. MAR, Parker-Hannifin Corp. PH, FedEx Corp. FDX and Agilent Technologies, Inc. A.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\nTop Research Reports for Visa, Marriott International and Parker-Hannifin\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc., Marriott International, Inc. and Parker-Hannifin Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nVisa's shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+20.9% vs. +15.7%). The company's stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.\n\nThe fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nShares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company's upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends.\n\nAlso, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Marriott International here >>>)\n\nShares ofParker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.\n\nHigher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company's Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin's margins. The company's measures to add shareholder value hold promise.\n\nHowever, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH's top line. A weak liquidity position is also worrisome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Parker-Hannifin here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include FedEx Corp. and Agilent Technologies, Inc..\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nIn a world in constant evolution and growth, more and more companies are needed that are committed to development and research in the health area. These biotech companies are not only doing the job, but also have potential for future growth.\nLet’s take a quick look at these biotech stocks to buy.\nAgilent (A)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nAgilent Technologies (NYSE:A) is a key player in the life sciences industry, providing vital solutions for laboratories and research facilities. Although it is not a traditional biotech company, its impact on the biotech and healthcare sectors is notable.\nIn their recent third quarter report, they faced a 2.7% decline in year-on-year revenues, reflecting weaker market conditions. However, the company demonstrated its resilience, showing a 7% increase in non-GAAP net income. Despite these challenges, Agilent adjusted its outlook for the year, anticipating a 0.7% decline to flat growth.\nOne positive aspect of the report is Agilent’s commitment to shareholders, as evidenced by the 5% increase in the quarterly dividend, reflecting confidence in the company’s financial position. This move may appeal to investors looking for stable returns.\nOn the biotech front, they received FDA approval for their PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx as a diagnostic tool. This approval is crucial for identifying patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma eligible for treatment with KEYTRUDA, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Merck (NYSE:MRK). The significance lies in the fact that PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic for this purpose, demonstrating Agilent’s leadership in the development of companion diagnostics.\nExact Sciences (EXAS)\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\nExact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) stands out as a key player in the field of cancer detection and diagnostics, attracting the attention of investors seeking innovative opportunities. Its recent financial report for the third quarter of 2023 reveals impressive growth, with total revenues of $628 million, a significant 20% increase over the same period last year. Core revenues, excluding exceptionals, showed an even more remarkable increase of 23%, driven by a 31% increase in the Screening segment and a 3% increase in Precision Oncology revenues.\nIn particular, Exact Sciences made waves with the groundbreaking BLUE-C assay results presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology. The next-generation Cologuard test showed an exceptional sensitivity of 94% for colorectal cancer with a specificity of 91%, outperforming fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) in detecting cancer or pre-cancer. In addition, the test demonstrated higher sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions compared to FIT.\nBeyond the financial success, they showed their commitment to advancing cancer detection and treatment at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2023. The company presented data on its blood-based early detection program for multiple cancers and results from OncoExTra, which provides information on actionable fusions in people with solid tumors.\nSoleno Therapeutics (SLNO)\nSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.com\nSoleno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SLNO) is like a medical beacon working passionately in the field of rare diseases. Its flagship, diazoxide choline extended-release tablets (DCCR), has recently achieved great success in the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In a long-term study, DCCR showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo, bringing hope and good vibes to those suffering from this difficult syndrome.\nWhat is even more encouraging is that DCCR is not only effective, but also a good teammate, as it is generally well tolerated and has no unexpected safety issues. These findings, presented at the Prader-Willi Research Foundation Symposium, are like a victory cheer for both the scientific community and the individuals and families affected by PWS.\nBut these are not just victories on the medical front. Soleno, as a company, is making strategic moves on the financial front. Closing a round of funding to the tune of $129 million is like giving a strong dose of energy to their research and development efforts. They have even welcomed new members to their board, such as industry veteran Matthew Pauls, and added Dr. Mike Huang to their clinical development team.\nLooking at their playbook, Soleno is not slowing down. They have published results, are making financial moves, and with an NDA submission for DCCR on the horizon, it looks like they are gearing up for a groundbreaking chapter in their journey to make a meaningful impact on rare diseases.\nAs of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

         "Wednesday, November 22, 2023\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), Marriott International, Inc. (MAR) and Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nVisa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+20.9% vs. +15.7%). The company’s stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.\n\nThe fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nShares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company’s upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends.\n\nAlso, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Marriott International here >>>)\n\nShares of Parker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.\n\nHigher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin’s margins. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise.\n\nHowever, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH’s top line. A weak liquidity position is also worrisome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Parker-Hannifin here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include FedEx Corp. (FDX), América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX) and Agilent Technologies, Inc.

The bottom line decreased 10% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues of $1.69 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 billion. However, the top line was down 8.7% on a reported basis and 9.7% on a core basis from the respective year-ago levels.\n\nThe decline was attributed to broad-based weakness across all the end markets, especially in Chemistry & Advanced Materials, Pharma, Food and Diagnostics and Clinical markets.\n\nAlso, weak momentum in China was a major concern. The company witnessed a year-over-year decline of 31% in its business in China in the reported quarter.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc.

The figure remained flat year over year on a core basis. The figure came above the consensus mark of $345 million. Segmental growth was attributed to strength in the NASD business.\n\nHowever, weakness in the genomics business was a negative.\nOperating Results\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, gross margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 100 basis points (bps) to 59.6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. ACG’s gross margin expanded by 180 bps to 50.4%.

This, in turn, will aid Agilent to solidify its footing in the global cancer diagnostics market.\n\nPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors market is expected to hit $45.8 billion in 2023 and reach $104.6 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 18% between 2023 and 2028.\n\nA Future Market Insights report indicates that the global cancer diagnostics market will reach $126 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2033.\n\nWe believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions.\n\nAgilent has lost 24.1% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s decline of 4.6%.\nExpanding DGG Segment\nApart from the latest move, Agilent released the enhanced xCELLigence RTCA Software Pro Version 2.8, a software package for real-time cell analysis in GMP-regulated facilities, ensuring data authenticity and compliance.\n\nFurther, Agilent launched the Agilent SureSelect Cancer CGP Assay, a pan-cancer assay designed for somatic variant profiling of solid tumor types, utilizing an NGS panel of 679 genes.\n\nWe note that all the above-mentioned endeavors will likely act as a catalyst for its customer base expansion.\n\nNotably, Agilent signed a Research Collaboration Agreement with the National Cancer Centre Singapore to expedite translational cancer research on Asian-prevalent cancer genomics over two years.\n\nFurther, the agreement involves the provision of an Agilent Magnis NGS Preparation System for investigating specific details in Asian cancer cohorts, where tissue samples are limited locally and regionally.\n\nMoreover, Agilent signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore, to install and operate its xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer, aiming to advance cell and gene therapy over the next three years.\n\nAll these endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the DGG segment in the days ahead.\n\nFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, revenues in the underlined segment increased 3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported as well as a core basis to $349 million.\n\nOur model estimate for DGG revenues for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $1.41 billion, indicating growth of 1.5% from the 2022 level. The same for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 stands at $1.48 billion and $1.58 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 5% and 7%, respectively.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Badger Meter BMI, Arista Networks ANET and Salesforce CRM. While Badger Meter sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Arista Networks and Salesforce carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nBadger Meter shares have gained 35.9% in the year-to-date period.

         "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Agilent Technologies (A) reports results for the quarter ended October 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.4%.\nRevenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent?\nFor Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.53%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Agilent will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Agilent would post earnings of $1.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.43, delivering a surprise of +4.38%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAgilent doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n4 Oil Stocks with Massive Upsides\nGlobal demand for oil is through the roof... and oil producers are struggling to keep up.

         "While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",
         "This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",
         "The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). For Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects.",
         "The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Agilent would post earnings of $1.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.43, delivering a surprise of +4.38%."

At the same time, the Dow lost 0.12%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.08%.\nShares of the scientific instrument maker have depreciated by 2.43% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.55% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.72%.\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Agilent Technologies in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on November 20, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.34, down 12.42% from the prior-year quarter.

Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance.

Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 23.35, so one might conclude that Agilent Technologies is trading at a discount comparatively.\nMeanwhile, A's PEG ratio is currently 1.96.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nAmetek shares have added about 0.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.5%.\nWhat's Next for Ametek?\nWhile Ametek has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ametek: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

         "Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30."

         "Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) saw new options become available today, for the December 15th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\nThe put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.75. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $102.25 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $109.28/share today.\nBecause the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.62% return on the cash commitment, or 16.76% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $109.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.78% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.12% boost of extra return to the investor, or 26.35% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $109.28) to be 27%.

This, in turn, will strengthen Agilent’s Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) segment.\n\nMoreover, the deal will also strengthen Agilent’s footprint in Asian markets.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc.

The solution includes a dedicated column thermostat, multi-angle light scattering detector, GPC/SEC-Ready Kit, and WinGPC Software for advanced material characterization.\n\nAdditionally, Agilent's 1260 Infinity II Hybrid Multisampler, 1290 Infinity II Bio Online Sample Manager and Revident Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS System were also displayed at the HPLC 2023 conference.\n\nFurther, Agilent Technologies introduced new liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems, Agilent 6495D LC/TQ and Revident LC/Q-TOF, along with new software for profiling and library management, ensuring high analytical sensitivity and efficiency for fast, high-quality data and early maintenance feedback for optimal performance.\n\nAlso, Agilent launched the Agilent 8697 Headspace Sampler -XL Tray, offering 120 vial capacity and enhanced instrument intelligence features for increased uptime and operator ease of use compared to its predecessor.\n\nAll these endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the LSAG segment in the days ahead.\n\nHowever, the sluggish pharma market continues to remain a concern.\n\nOur model estimate for LSAG revenues for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $3.85 billion, indicating a decline of 3.9% from the fiscal 2022 level.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Asure Software ASUR, Applied Materials AMAT and Arista Networks ANET.

         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nStocks ended the third quarter on a sour note. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive posture against inflation combined with soaring interest rates have investors taking defensive measures.\nBut it’s not time to give up on the stock market. In fact, thanks to the recent selling, bargains are springing up across many S&P 500 stocks.\nLet’s examine three that will benefit from current market conditions and rally heading into 2024.\nWells Fargo (WFC)\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the big banks that is thriving amid the industry’s correction. That’s because Wells Fargo did not aggressively expand its balance sheet or buy overvalued securities over the past few years.\nTrue, investors have shunned nearly all financials stocks this year amid unprecedented volatility in the interest rate markets. Banks that were positioned poorly, like First Republic and Silicon Valley, ended up going bust. And others are suffering from falling profitability and strained balance sheets at the present time.\nMeanwhile, Wells Fargo has positioned its balance sheet to earn far more profits as interest rates rise. And those rates are normally beneficial to the banking sector as a whole. For firms like Wells Fargo that managed their risks and exposures properly, that remains true in 2023.\nSpecifically, Wells Fargo’s net interest margin (NIM), the spread between its loan interest and deposit payments, has soared from 2.2% in Q2 of last year to 3.1% today. With a near 50% jump in core profitability on its loan book, it’s no wonder that Wells Fargo is reporting rising earnings. WFC stock hasn’t yet snapped out of the industrywide doldrums. As a result, shares go for just eight times forward earnings today.\nCharles River Laboratories (CRL)\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\nCharles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) is a leading healthcare company focused on providing lab tools and services related to pharmaceutical drug development.\nHistorically, it’s been the dominant player in animal models. Specifically, Charles River procures, breeds, and distributes lab rats, mice, rabbits, and non-human primates. The last one got Charles River in trouble, as the company was implicated in an investigation into alleged macaque smuggling in Cambodia. However, as of last quarter, Charles River has been able to resolve its sourcing issues around non-human primates.\nMore broadly, CRL stock has slumped amid the slowdown in the biotech industry. With smaller biotech companies struggling to obtain funding, Charles River is experiencing less trials and revenue-generating business. Yet, it’s only a matter of time until biotech funding rises again, given the priority to find cures for rare diseases.\nCRL will inevitably be part of those future cures. In fact, the company was involved in developing more than 80% of all drugs that received FDA approval since 2020. In effect, Charles River is a tax on the entire biotech industry, with their consistent postings of compounded earnings per share growth rate in the teens since the turn of the century.\nThanks to the recent scandal and biotech industry’s slump, CRL shares are now on sale at an unusually low 18 times forward earnings.\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS)\nSource: Funtap / Shutterstock.com\nKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) is a company that provides testing, product quality, and design solutions to technology companies. The firm has an interesting history.\nKeysight sprung up originally as Hewlett-Packard‘s Test & Measurement division more than half a century ago, and was ultimately spun off from Agilent (NYSE:A) into its own publicly-traded entity in 2014.\nKEYS stock has been incredibly successful over the past decade. Since 2014, shares jumped from $30 to a peak of more than $200. However, Keysight has fallen amid a slowdown in telecom and information technology spending over the past year. That  has led KEYS stock to slide back to around $130 today.\nThe weakness makes sense, as Keysight is heavily involved in quality control and testing for telecom companies. With 5G rollouts seeing an underwhelming debut as compared to expectations, that has cast a shadow on industry vendors. Other Keysight segments such as services for edge computing and RFID functions have slipped as demand levels off following an unusually robust 2021 and 2022.\nIndeed, the market is blowing the situation way out of proportion. KEYS stock is down to 16 times forward earnings, which is quite the discount for a tech company that has reliably posted double-digit earnings growth. It’s only a matter of time until telecom spending picks back up given the ever-growing demand for mobile data.\nAlso, Keysight is active in emerging growth fields such as AI and next-generation semiconductors. Investors should take advantage of the current dip in KEYS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in KEYS, CRL, and WFC stock.

         "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Agilent Technologies (A). Shares have lost about 6.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Agilent due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nAgilent Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates\nAgilent Technologies delivered third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $1.43 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. The bottom line increased by 7% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.\n\nRevenues of $1.67 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 billion. However, the top line was down 2.7% on a reported basis and 2.3% on a core basis from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s levels.\n\nThe decline was attributed to sluggishness in Chemistry & Advanced Materials and Pharma & Biopharma markets due to weak momentum in China.\n\nNevertheless, growth in Academia & Gov’t, Food, Environmental & Forensics and Diagnostics and Clinical markets remained a positive.\nSegmental Top Line Details\nAgilent has three reporting segments, namely, Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG), Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG).\n\nLSAG: The segment accounted for $927 million or 55% of its total revenues, down 9% on a reported as well as on a core basis from the respective prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. This was due to macroeconomic uncertainties, soft market conditions in China and a sluggish pharma market. The reported figure came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $929 million.\n\nACG: Revenues from the segment were $396 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues. The figure surpassed the consensus mark of $377 million. The top line improved by 10% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading on a reported basis and by 11% on a core basis, demonstrating solid momentum across all regions and end markets. A strong demand for the company’s services was a positive.\n\nDGG: Revenues increased 3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported as well as a core basis to $349 million, accounting for the remaining 21% of total revenues. The figure came slightly below the consensus mark of $3508 million. Segmental growth was attributed to strength in the NASD business. A solid demand for diagnostic tests contributed well to the company’s pathology business.\n\nHowever, weakness in genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses was a negative.\nOperating Results\nFor the fiscal third quarter, gross margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 50 basis points (bps) to 29.9% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. ACG’s gross margin expanded by 390 bps to 50.9%. DGG’s gross margin contracted by 180 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to 52.2%.\n\nResearch & development (R&D) costs were $118 million, up 1.7% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $407 million, down 1.2% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s figure. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses expanded by 35 bps year over year to 7.05%.

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Agilent shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Agilent is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Electronics - Testing Equipment industry that ranks in the Bottom 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.61 per share to $1.35 in that period.\nGiven the way analysts feel about Agilent right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\nLooking to Trade Options?\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

         "Imagine discovering a treasure map that leads to the chest containing the loot. Consider that the investment world has its own version of these concealed treasures: Spinoffs. These financial treasures have the potential to reshape your entire investment voyage, not just enhance your portfolio. The catch? You must look for them and do some work. A tough ask, I know.\nWhat is A Spinoff?\nIn a Spinoff, a parent company separates one of its business entities or divisions into a standalone, independent company. By distributing shares of the spun-off company to the current proprietors of the parent, two separate publicly listed entities are created. The new enterprise that emerges because of a Spinoff is often referred to as a \"Spinoff company.\" Spinoffs can increase shareholder value by allowing distinct companies to focus on their core competencies and releasing hidden value in specific business divisions. In addition, it offers investors the option to invest in various companies based on their investment preferences and risk tolerance. Or, alternatively, eradicate them.\nThe media frequently gets it wrong when speaking about Spinoffs. This is a very important point to remember. A ‘true’ Spinoff only happens when a share of a division is distributed amongst existing shareholders that own the parent company. Contrary to the media, IPOs, Divestitures, carve-outs, split-offs, and split-ups are not Spinoffs and consequently, these transactions lose many of the value creating dynamics of the Spinoff corporate action. Cross-reference information from various trustworthy sources, particularly official business communication. To fully comprehend the Spinoff and its ramifications, investors should also look for information from reliable financial analysts, subject-matter experts, and formal regulatory filings, such as those with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nDo Spinoffs Outperform? \nThe “Spinoff” is an essentially inefficient method for distributing stock to the incorrect individuals. You receive shares whether you desire them or not. Typically, investors acquire these shares by default and sell them on the open market almost immediately, making them inexpensive companies that no one is interested in. They are occasionally referred to as \"orphan securities.\" At this point, X marks the location, and digging should commence.\nWhy the dynamics of Spinoffs make it an essential area for an investor to analyze:\nStudies have shown that Spinoffs have historically beaten the market by over 10 percent as the pure, newly focused business takes off.\nCompensation for executives can be more closely correlated with business performance. The company will become smaller, which will increase the executives' motivation and sense of ownership.\nSeparating companies allows each entity to be properly valued and can sometimes unlock a “conglomerate discount.\"\nDue to the likelihood that the company would be small and lack a roadshow, it is under-followed. As a result, there are more chances for investors to discover returns greater than the index.\nThe Edge Consulting Groups 20 year study shows that Spinoffs are likely to be taken over. Roughly 35 percent are acquired around the two-year mark post-Spinoff.\nTypically, there are hundreds of Spinoff situations a year. Around 40 have over $1 billion in market cap. This is a sweet spot where liquidity and “real” companies come together in my opinion.\n5 Reasons Why You Should Be Looking For These Situations \nIncluding Spinoffs in your investment portfolio can provide a variety of benefits, including diversification, undervalued opportunities, and the potential for higher returns and enhanced performance.\n1. Enhanced Diversification: Incorporating Spinoffs introduces a new layer of diversification. Since Spinoff companies often operate in different sectors than their parent companies, they can provide exposure to industries that might not have been represented in your portfolio. This helps spread risk and reduces the impact of negative events within a specific sector.\n2. Undervalued Opportunities: Spinoffs are sometimes overlooked by the market, leading to potential undervaluation. This presents an opportunity for investors to purchase shares of promising companies at a lower price compared to their intrinsic value. As the market gradually recognizes their worth, these undervalued gems can yield substantial returns.\n3. Focused Management: Spinoff companies can streamline operations and focus on their core competencies, which often leads to improved efficiency and performance. The management teams of these newly independent entities tend to be more agile and dedicated to the success of their specific business, potentially translating into better growth prospects.\n4. Catalyst for Change: The newfound independence of a Spinoff can lead to strategic changes, such as cost-cutting initiatives, innovation, and targeted expansion plans. These changes can drive improved financial performance and boost shareholder value over time.\n5. Potential for Outperformance: Historical data indicates that Spinoffs often outperform the broader market indices. This outperformance can be attributed to a combination of factors, including improved focus, better capital allocation decisions, and the market's eventual recognition of the Spinoff's value proposition.\nWhy isn’t Everybody Looking At Them?\nI asked the legendary investor Joel Greenblatt this question once and he didn’t hesitate to give me the answer. ‘No one wants to do the work.’ Spinoffs analysis takes a lot of effort and, surprise, surprise, not many want to do it. However, as an investment veteran of over 30 years, I can categorically say that some of my most profitable ideas come from doing a hell of a lot of work and finding the angle and edge in the situation in this area. Furthermore, they are not promoted by brokers. Unlike an IPO there is no stock to sell you. You gain the Spinoff from holding the parent company whether you like it or not. This opens a whole range of dynamics that are interesting for investing. \nRecent Spinoffs That You May Know\nAbbVie (ABBV)  (formerly known as Abbott Laboratories' biopharmaceutical business) was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. AbbVie has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 200% since the spinoff.\nVisa (V) was spun off from Bank of America (BAC) in 2008. Visa has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 400% since Spinoff.\nMastercard (MA) was spun off from American Express (AXP) in 2006. Mastercard has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 300% since Spinoff.\nAgilent Technologies (A)  was spun off from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)  in 1999. Agilent Technologies has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 200% since the spinoff.\nJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ)  Life Sciences division was spun off as a separate company called Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies in 2017. Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 50% since the spinoff.\nThese are just a few examples of successful stock Spinoffs. There are many other examples, and the success of a spinoff can vary depending on several factors, such as the underlying business, the management team, and the market condition.\nIn Summary \nIf you are after hidden value where no one else is looking, look no further than this area of the market. There are services out there that can help, but ultimately a little hard work in a proven area will get you to some positive wealth creation a lot faster than competing with the masses.\nOn the date of publication, Jim Osman did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

         "By David Carnevali\nNEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Danaher Corp DHR.N is in the lead to acquire Abcam Plc ABCM.O, a provider of supplies to life science researchers with a market value of $5.4 billion, as it expands its biomedical offerings, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\nAbcam believes that Danaher's all-cash offer is superior to a rival bid from Agilent Technologies Inc A.N, the sources said.\nThe exact price that Danaher is offering could not be learned. One of the sources said the deal price would be close to Abcam's current valuation, given that its stock has already risen more than 20% after Bloomberg News reported on June 16 that the company was fielding takeover interest.\nIf the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that no agreement is certain and that the outcome could still change. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.\nAbcam, Danaher and Agilent did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nAbcam shares rose as much as 9% in afternoon trading in New York on Friday to $24.52. Danaher shares were up 1.3% at $256.76.\nBased in Cambridge, England, Abcam supplies antibodies, reagents and other products used in medical research. The company serves roughly 750,000 research scientists at academic, research, government and biopharmaceutical organizations.\nAbcam has come under pressure from activist shareholders to sell itself, including its founder Jonathan Milner who owns 6.1% of the company, as well as hedge fund Starboard Value LP, complaining about the company's stock underperforming for most of the last two years.\nDanaher, one of the world's largest suppliers of diagnostic tools with a market value of $190 billion, has turned to dealmaking to expand in the sector. Abcam's antibody and reagent solutions could help Danaher win more and bigger contracts with some customers.\nDanaher acquired General Electric Co's GE.N biopharma solution business for $21.4 billion in 2019 and contract development and manufacturing organization Aldevron for $9.6 billion in 2021.\n(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Nick Zieminski)\n((Greg.Roumeliotis@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6022; Reuters Messaging: greg.roumeliotis.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nAugust has been a great month for investors looking for bargain stocks to buy on the dip. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq 100 were down 2,1%, 2.0%, and 2.4%, respectively, for the week of Aug. 14-18. Barron’s believes that September could be worse. If the past week is any indication, they could be on to something. \nFundstrat analyst Tom Lee thinks August has been its typical mercurial self where gains are hard to come by and that the good times should return soon. Baron’s reported Lee’s comments from his Aug. 18 note to clients:\n“[T]he month’s declines haven’t shaken Lee’s core bullish thesis. ‘We see this more as ‘it’s August’ rather than the start of a larger rout…we are not in the camp this spills over into a wider selloff. That could happen, but more bad things need to emerge. In fact, there are some signs that we could see the stocks begin to stabilize soon.’”\nSo, if you’re a risk-averse investor, you might want to wait a couple of weeks to see if the markets bottom. \nIn the meantime, a quick screen of S&P 500 stocks down more than 20% over the past month gives bargain-hunting investors 14 stocks to choose from. Here are three undervalued due to their 20%, including one name from three different sectors. \nSealed Air (SEE)\nSource: Shutterstock\nSealed Air (NYSE:SEE) represents the materials sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 31% year-to-date. \nAnalysts are moderately optimistic about the stock, with 7 of the 15 rating it as Overweight or an outright Buy. It’s target price is $45 which is 31% higher than its current share price. \nOne of the things that I use to assess value is free cash flow yield. If it’s over 8%, it’s definitely value. Between 4% and 8%, it’s reasonable value, if not dirt cheap. In the trailing 12 months ended June 30, its free cash flow was $152 million. Based on an enterprise value of $9.78 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 1.6%, which suggests it’s not cheap.\nBefore you toss the company best known for bubble wrap packaging overboard, consider its historical FCF yield. In 2020, it had a free cash flow of $556 million. Based on an enterprise value of $10.6 billion. At first glance, it appears Sealed Air’s business has deteriorated. \nAnd to a certain extent, it has, which is why it’s moving forwqard with SEE 2.0. This revitalization plan should deliver $150 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2025 and a return to its historical earnings and sales growth in 2024. \nIts stock hasn’t been this low since June 2020. Get ready for a revival in the waning months of 2023 and into 2024.\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS)\nSource: fantasyform/Shutterstock.com\nKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) represents the tech sector. Its stock is down 23% for the past month and 24% year-to-date. Like Sealed Air, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.\nKeysight is a relatively new company by S&P 500 standards, incorporated in 2013. However, its history dates back to 1939 and Hewlett-Packard’s founding by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. Their first product was an audio oscillator. Electronic measurement was their business.\nIn 1999, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) was formed to operate HP’s Medical Products and Instrument Group. In 2013, Agilent was split into two pure-play electronic measurement companies. Keysight was the one of the two, going public on November 1, 2014 after separating from Agilent. Agilent shareholders got one share of Keysight for two held by the parent. \nKEYS stock is up 335% since it began trading in November 2014. Agilent is up 191% over the same period.\nShares have lost their mojo recently because the company reported Q3 2023 results on August 18th that included a downward revision of its guidance. It now expects fourth-quarter sales and earnings to decline by 10% and 13%, respectively. \nCurrently trading at 4.16x sales — less than its five-year average of 5.1x — its enterprise value of $22.5 billion is 12.87x its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That’s lower than it’s been since 2016.\nResMed (RMD)\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\nResMed (NYSE:RMD) represents the healthcare sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 21% year-to-date. Like the other two, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.\nInterestingly, ResMed’s business is probably doing the best in terms of top-line growth among the trio, up 23% in Q4 2023 and 18% for all of 2023 to $4.2 billion. However, investors began to abandon the stock after hearing its gross margin (56.5%) and operating margin (29.0%) dropped for the year.    \nAll of its stock losses in 2023 are post-earnings. Investors have rightly or wrongly decided that the contraction of its margins in light of double-digit revenue growth suggests the quality of the sales increase for the maker of sleep apnea equipment is suspect. \nResMed CEO Mick Farrell is very confident about the future. He stated in the Q4 2023 conference call:\n“Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients.”\nOf the 24 analysts covering the stock, 18 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy with a $240 median price, 45% higher than its current share price. \nI see ResMed as the best long-term hold of the trio, although all three should make you money over 3-5 years.    \nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

         "Interesting A Put And Call Options For August 2024",
         "A",
         "Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new August 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\nThe put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.99/share today.\nBecause the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.60% return on the cash commitment, or 5.45% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $138.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.75% if the stock gets called away at the August 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $138.99) to be 27%.

         "A",
         "Fintel reports that on December 13, 2023, Wolfe Research initiated coverage of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) with a Outperform recommendation.\nAnalyst Price Forecast Suggests 1.04% Downside\nAs of November 27, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 132.34. The forecasts range from a low of 101.00 to a high of $157.50. The average price target represents a decrease of 1.04% from its latest reported closing price of 133.74.\nSee our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.\nThe projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 4.35%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77.\nAgilent Technologies Declares $0.24 Dividend\nOn November 15, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share ($0.94 annualized). Shareholders of record as of January 2, 2024 will receive the payment on January 24, 2024. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share.\nAt the current share price of $133.74 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.71%.\nLooking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.72%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.14 (n=235).\nThe current dividend yield is 0.12 standard deviations below the historical average.\nAdditionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.22. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.\nThe company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.22%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.\nWhat is the Fund Sentiment?\nThere are 1945 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies. This is an increase of 30 owner(s) or 1.57% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to A is 0.31%, a decrease of 2.75%. Total shares owned by institutions increased in the last three months by 1.25% to 300,740K shares.\nThe put/call ratio of A is 1.01, indicating a bearish outlook.\nWhat are Other Shareholders Doing?\nMassachusetts Financial Services holds 11,076K shares representing 3.79% ownership of the company.

         "Agilent Technologies Reaches Analyst Target Price",
         "A",
         "In recent trading, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $132.36, changing hands for $133.74/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\nThere are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agilent Technologies, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $146.00. The standard deviation is $12.779.\nBut the whole reason to look at the average A price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with A crossing above that average target price of $132.36/share, investors in A have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $132.36 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Agilent Technologies, Inc.:\nRECENT A ANALYST RATINGS BREAKDOWN\n» Current 1 Month Ago 2 Month Ago 3 Month Ago\nStrong buy ratings: 7 9 9 9\nBuy ratings: 0 0 0 0\nHold ratings: 7 5 5 4\nSell ratings: 0 0 0 0\nStrong sell ratings: 1 1 1 1\nAverage rating: 2.2 1.93 1.93 1.86\nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

         "A",
         "Agilent Technologies A is enhancing its BioTek product line on the back of portfolio expansions and technology upgrades.\n\nNotably, Agilent enhanced the BioTek Cytation C10 confocal imaging reader with the addition of water immersion and confocal spinning disk technology.\n\nFurther, the water immersion technology can be used in light microscopy to increase numerical aperture, reduce z-axis distortion, and improve image quality by placing water between the objective lens and sample.\n\nAdditionally, the technology aids researchers in reducing exposure times in live-cell applications, thereby reducing the traditional phototoxic effects associated with these experiments.\n\nMoreover, this addition offers a deep-sectioning spinning disk technology, enhancing microscopic images by blocking out-of-focus light, resulting in clearer, more quantitative results.\n\nAgilent is anticipated to gain significant traction among researchers utilizing live-cell and 3D applications on the back of its latest move.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\nGrowth Prospects\nThe latest move positions the company well to strengthen its footing in the global microplate reader and live cell imaging markets.\n\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global microplate reader market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period 2023-2030.\n\nA Mordor Intelligence report indicates the global live cell imaging market size will reach $2.95 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.06% between 2023 and 2028.\n\nWe believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nHowever, the company has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions.\n\nAgilent has lost 13.9% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 0.9%.\nACG Segment in Focus\nThe latest move bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) segment.\n\nNotably, Agilent Technologies launched Gen6 software for all Agilent BioTek detection instruments, offering automated optimization tools and improved navigation through built-in data analysis functions.\n\nFurther, the company introduced the Agilent BioTek 406 FX washer dispenser, a compact tool that combines reagent dispensing and plate-washing, suitable for automated systems and benchtop use.\n\nAll the abovementioned endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the ACG segment in the days ahead.\n\nIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the ACG segment revenues increased 6% year over year to $404 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues.\n\nOur model projects fiscal 2024 ACG segment revenues at $1.64 billion, indicating growth of 4.7% from 2022.\n\nStrong momentum in the underlined segment will likely aid its overall financial performance in the upcoming period.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Badger Meter BMI, Arista Networks ANET and Adobe ADBE. While Badger Meter currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Arista Networks and Adobe carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nShares of Badger Meter have gained 37.8% in the year-to-date period.

The company's stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.\n\nThe fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nShares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company's upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends.\n\nAlso, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Marriott International here >>>)\n\nShares ofParker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.\n\nHigher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company's Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin's margins. The company's measures to add shareholder value hold promise.\n\nHowever, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH's top line.

         "3 Biotech Stocks With Big-Time Breakthrough Potential",
         "A",
         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nIn a world in constant evolution and growth, more and more companies are needed that are committed to development and research in the health area. These biotech companies are not only doing the job, but also have potential for future growth.\nLet’s take a quick look at these biotech stocks to buy.\nAgilent (A)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nAgilent Technologies (NYSE:A) is a key player in the life sciences industry, providing vital solutions for laboratories and research facilities. Although it is not a traditional biotech company, its impact on the biotech and healthcare sectors is notable.\nIn their recent third quarter report, they faced a 2.7% decline in year-on-year revenues, reflecting weaker market conditions. However, the company demonstrated its resilience, showing a 7% increase in non-GAAP net income. Despite these challenges, Agilent adjusted its outlook for the year, anticipating a 0.7% decline to flat growth.\nOne positive aspect of the report is Agilent’s commitment to shareholders, as evidenced by the 5% increase in the quarterly dividend, reflecting confidence in the company’s financial position. This move may appeal to investors looking for stable returns.\nOn the biotech front, they received FDA approval for their PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx as a diagnostic tool. This approval is crucial for identifying patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma eligible for treatment with KEYTRUDA, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Merck (NYSE:MRK). The significance lies in the fact that PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic for this purpose, demonstrating Agilent’s leadership in the development of companion diagnostics.\nExact Sciences (EXAS)\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\nExact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) stands out as a key player in the field of cancer detection and diagnostics, attracting the attention of investors seeking innovative opportunities. Its recent financial report for the third quarter of 2023 reveals impressive growth, with total revenues of $628 million, a significant 20% increase over the same period last year. Core revenues, excluding exceptionals, showed an even more remarkable increase of 23%, driven by a 31% increase in the Screening segment and a 3% increase in Precision Oncology revenues.\nIn particular, Exact Sciences made waves with the groundbreaking BLUE-C assay results presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology. The next-generation Cologuard test showed an exceptional sensitivity of 94% for colorectal cancer with a specificity of 91%, outperforming fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) in detecting cancer or pre-cancer. In addition, the test demonstrated higher sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions compared to FIT.\nBeyond the financial success, they showed their commitment to advancing cancer detection and treatment at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2023. The company presented data on its blood-based early detection program for multiple cancers and results from OncoExTra, which provides information on actionable fusions in people with solid tumors.\nSoleno Therapeutics (SLNO)\nSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.com\nSoleno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SLNO) is like a medical beacon working passionately in the field of rare diseases. Its flagship, diazoxide choline extended-release tablets (DCCR), has recently achieved great success in the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In a long-term study, DCCR showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo, bringing hope and good vibes to those suffering from this difficult syndrome.\nWhat is even more encouraging is that DCCR is not only effective, but also a good teammate, as it is generally well tolerated and has no unexpected safety issues. These findings, presented at the Prader-Willi Research Foundation Symposium, are like a victory cheer for both the scientific community and the individuals and families affected by PWS.\nBut these are not just victories on the medical front. Soleno, as a company, is making strategic moves on the financial front. Closing a round of funding to the tune of $129 million is like giving a strong dose of energy to their research and development efforts. They have even welcomed new members to their board, such as industry veteran Matthew Pauls, and added Dr. Mike Huang to their clinical development team.\nLooking at their playbook, Soleno is not slowing down. They have published results, are making financial moves, and with an NDA submission for DCCR on the horizon, it looks like they are gearing up for a groundbreaking chapter in their journey to make a meaningful impact on rare diseases.\nAs of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

         "A",
         "Wednesday, November 22, 2023\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), Marriott International, Inc. (MAR) and Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nVisa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+20.9% vs. +15.7%). The company’s stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.\n\nThe fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nShares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company’s upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends.\n\nAlso, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Marriott International here >>>)\n\nShares of Parker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.\n\nHigher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin’s margins. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise.\n\nHowever, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH’s top line. A weak liquidity position is also worrisome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Parker-Hannifin here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include FedEx Corp. (FDX), América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX) and Agilent Technologies, Inc.

         "A",
         "Agilent Technologies A delivered fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $1.38 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.99%. The bottom line decreased 10% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues of $1.69 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 billion. However, the top line was down 8.7% on a reported basis and 9.7% on a core basis from the respective year-ago levels.\n\nThe decline was attributed to broad-based weakness across all the end markets, especially in Chemistry & Advanced Materials, Pharma, Food and Diagnostics and Clinical markets.\n\nAlso, weak momentum in China was a major concern. The company witnessed a year-over-year decline of 31% in its business in China in the reported quarter.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc.

Quote\nSegmental Top-Line Details\nAgilent has three reporting segments, namely, Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (“LSAG”), Agilent Cross Lab Group (“ACG”) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (“DGG”).\n\nLSAG: The segment accounted for $928 million or 55% of its total revenues, down 17% on a reported basis and 18% on a core basis from the respective prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. This was due to macroeconomic uncertainties, soft market conditions in China and sluggish capital spending by the customers. The reported figure came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $925 million.\n\nACG: Revenues from the segment were $404 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues. The figure surpassed the consensus mark of $401 million.

The figure remained flat year over year on a core basis. The figure came above the consensus mark of $345 million. Segmental growth was attributed to strength in the NASD business.\n\nHowever, weakness in the genomics business was a negative.\nOperating Results\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, gross margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 100 basis points (bps) to 59.6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. ACG’s gross margin expanded by 180 bps to 50.4%. DGG’s gross margin expanded by 90 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to 51.9%.\n\nResearch & development (“R&D”) costs were $114 million, down 4.2% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number.

As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses expanded by 40 bps year over year to 6.8%. SG&A expenses expanded by 50 bps year over year to 23.3%.\n\nOperating margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 24.2%, which declined 130 bps from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s figure.\n\nSegment-wise, the operating margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 460 bps to 28.1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number.

         "Agilent Technologies A is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 20.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, A expects revenues of $1.655-$1.705 billion, suggesting a decline between 12.2% and 9.5% on a core basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.67 billion, implying a decline of 9.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.\n\nAgilent’s non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.33-$1.36 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.34 per share, indicating a fall of 12.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.\n\nAgilent’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same once, the average being 4.76%.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n  Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\n Factors to Note\nThe company is expected to have gained from growing momentum across Agilent’s Cross Lab Group (“ACG”) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (“DGG”) segments during the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nThe ACG segment is likely to have benefited from robust portfolio offerings. Strength in services and solid momentum across all regions and end markets are likely to have contributed well.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACG is pegged at $401 million, implying growth of 5.2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.\n\nAgilent’s strength in the Nucleic Acid Solutions Division business is expected to have continued benefiting the DGG segment’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter. Also, solid demand for diagnostic tests is expected to have aided the performance of the company’s pathology business.\n\nHowever, weakness in genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses might have been a negative\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for DGG is pegged at $345 million, implying a fall of 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.\n\nStrength in liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and lab consumables is expected to have benefited Agilent’s Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (“LSAG”) segment in the quarter under review.\n\nHowever, the weakening pharma market, macroeconomic uncertainties and soft market conditions in China are likely to have scaled down the LSAG segment’s revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LSAG is pegged at $925 million, implying a decline of 17.1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.\nWhat Our Model Says\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Agilent Technologies this time around.

         "Agilent Technologies A is leaving no stone unturned to bolster diagnostic tool offerings in a bid to strengthen its Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) segment.\n\nNotably, Agilent received FDA approval for its PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx diagnostic tool, which helps in Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma diagnosis.\n\nFurther, it identifies patients’ eligibility for treatment with KEYTRUDA, an anti-programmed cell death (PD1) therapy, along with chemotherapy, trastuzumab and fluoropyrimidine.\n\nAdditionally, PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx aids in identifying patients with non-small cell lung, esophageal, cervical, head and neck and triple-negative breast cancer who may be eligible for KEYTRUDA treatment.\n\nWe note that this approval would benefit cancer patients whose tumors express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1).\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\nGrowth Prospects\nThe latest announcement bodes well for the company’s deepening focus to strengthen its footprint in the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors market. This, in turn, will aid Agilent to solidify its footing in the global cancer diagnostics market.\n\nPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors market is expected to hit $45.8 billion in 2023 and reach $104.6 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 18% between 2023 and 2028.\n\nA Future Market Insights report indicates that the global cancer diagnostics market will reach $126 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2033.\n\nWe believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions.\n\nAgilent has lost 24.1% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s decline of 4.6%.\nExpanding DGG Segment\nApart from the latest move, Agilent released the enhanced xCELLigence RTCA Software Pro Version 2.8, a software package for real-time cell analysis in GMP-regulated facilities, ensuring data authenticity and compliance.\n\nFurther, Agilent launched the Agilent SureSelect Cancer CGP Assay, a pan-cancer assay designed for somatic variant profiling of solid tumor types, utilizing an NGS panel of 679 genes.\n\nWe note that all the above-mentioned endeavors will likely act as a catalyst for its customer base expansion.\n\nNotably, Agilent signed a Research Collaboration Agreement with the National Cancer Centre Singapore to expedite translational cancer research on Asian-prevalent cancer genomics over two years.\n\nFurther, the agreement involves the provision of an Agilent Magnis NGS Preparation System for investigating specific details in Asian cancer cohorts, where tissue samples are limited locally and regionally.\n\nMoreover, Agilent signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore, to install and operate its xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer, aiming to advance cell and gene therapy over the next three years.\n\nAll these endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the DGG segment in the days ahead.\n\nFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, revenues in the underlined segment increased 3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported as well as a core basis to $349 million.\n\nOur model estimate for DGG revenues for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $1.41 billion, indicating growth of 1.5% from the 2022 level. The same for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 stands at $1.48 billion and $1.58 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 5% and 7%, respectively.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Badger Meter BMI, Arista Networks ANET and Salesforce CRM. While Badger Meter sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Arista Networks and Salesforce carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nBadger Meter shares have gained 35.9% in the year-to-date period.

         "Analysts Estimate Agilent Technologies (A) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for",
         "A",
         "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Agilent Technologies (A) reports results for the quarter ended October 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.4%.\nRevenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent?\nFor Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.53%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Agilent will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Agilent would post earnings of $1.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.43, delivering a surprise of +4.38%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

         "In the latest trading session, Agilent Technologies (A) closed at $109.39, marking a -1.04% move from the previous day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.1%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.12%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.08%.\nShares of the scientific instrument maker have depreciated by 2.43% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.55% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.72%.\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Agilent Technologies in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on November 20, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.34, down 12.42% from the prior-year quarter. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $1.67 billion, indicating a 9.65% downward movement from the same quarter last year.\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Agilent Technologies. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 1.09% downward. At present, Agilent Technologies boasts a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\nInvestors should also note Agilent Technologies's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.55. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 23.35, so one might conclude that Agilent Technologies is trading at a discount comparatively.\nMeanwhile, A's PEG ratio is currently 1.96. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. A's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.24 as of yesterday's close.\nThe Electronics - Testing Equipment industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.67%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.64%.\nShares of the scientific instrument maker have depreciated by 6.25% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.51% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.21%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Agilent Technologies in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on November 20, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.37, down 10.46% from the prior-year quarter. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $1.67 billion, reflecting a 9.65% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Agilent Technologies. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.05% lower. At present, Agilent Technologies boasts a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\nInvestors should also note Agilent Technologies's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.1. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 24.31.\nIt's also important to note that A currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.91. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory.

         "A",
         "Ametek (AME) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.64 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.45 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.80%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices would post earnings of $1.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.57, delivering a surprise of 3.29%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nAmetek, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.62 billion for the quarter ended September 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.55 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nAmetek shares have added about 0.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.5%.\nWhat's Next for Ametek?\nWhile Ametek has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ametek: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.62 on $1.72 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.26 on $6.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the top 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nAnother stock from the same industry, Agilent Technologies (A), has yet to report results for the quarter ended October 2023. The results are expected to be released on November 20.\nThis scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\nAgilent Technologies' revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n5 Stocks Set to Double\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2023.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.\nIn trading on Monday, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 25.5, after changing hands as low as $96.80 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 30.8. A bullish investor could look at A's 25.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of A shares:\nLooking at the chart above, A's low point in its 52 week range is $96.80 per share, with $160.265 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $98.86.\nFind out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to know about »\nAlso see:\n Cheap Materials Shares\n SI Stock Predictions\n TPL Stock Predictions\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

         "A",
         "Oct 24 (Reuters) - Danaher DHR.N on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit as strong demand for its diagnostic tests for respiratory diseases helped soften the blow from weaker sales at the healthcare conglomerate's life-sciences unit.\nThe diagnostics unit, which makes kits, also used for COVID-19 testing, as well as reagents and other tools, reported sales of $2.25 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.12 billion, according to LSEG data.\nHowever, the life sciences unit, which provides reagents and lab equipment used in the discovery of new drugs and vaccines, posted sales of $1.71 billion, missing estimates of $1.78 billion.\n\"Revenue in the third quarter came in ahead of our expectations, with Biotechnology performing as anticipated, and higher respiratory testing revenue more than offsetting slightly softer-than-anticipated demand in Life Sciences,\" Danaher CEO Rainer Blair said in a statement.\nShares of the Washington D.C.-based company rose 1.2% to $206.50 before the bell.\nDanaher now expects a slight decline in adjusted core sales for the year, compared with its previous expectation of a low single-digit rise.\nLife sciences companies such as Danaher, Agilent A.N and Thermo Fisher TMO.N cut their annual profit forecasts earlier this year as some clients slashed their budgets for biopharma services due to a funding crunch.\nRising interest rates squeezed funding needed for drug development programs, weighing on demand for contract research services offered by Danaher and rival Thermo Fisher.\nDanaher's forecast excludes the impact of the spinoff of its Environmental & Applied Solutions unit, Veralto VLTO.N, which began trading on Oct. 2.\nOn an adjusted basis, Danaher reported a profit per share of $2.02, beating analysts' expectations of $1.87.\nThird-quarter sales of $6.87 billion also topped estimates of $6.63 billion.\n(Reporting by Christy Santhosh; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri and Sriraj Kalluvila)\n((Christy.Santhosh@thomsonreuters.com;))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

         "December 15th Options Now Available For Agilent Technologies (A)",
         "A",
         "Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) saw new options become available today, for the December 15th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\nThe put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.75. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $102.25 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $109.28/share today.\nBecause the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.62% return on the cash commitment, or 16.76% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $109.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.78% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.12% boost of extra return to the investor, or 26.35% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $109.28) to be 27%.

         "Agilent Technologies A signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Sarawak Infectious Disease Centre (SIDC) to provide its 6475 triple quadrupole LC/MS system for neglected tropical diseases (NTD) research.\n\nNotably, Agilent's 6475 LC/MS, which utilizes iFunnel technologies, will aid SIDC's research on tropical medicines and infectious diseases, enabling rapid outbreak response through extensive research and diagnostic capabilities.\n\nFurther, the 6475 LC/MS system enhances signal response and optimizes research outcomes through technology and knowledge transfer, capacity building, research programs and human capital development.\n\nSIDC plans to use Agilent's capabilities as it prepares for facility completion by December 2025.\n\nWe note that the latest move has expanded the customer base of Agilent’s liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) systems. This, in turn, will strengthen Agilent’s Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) segment.\n\nMoreover, the deal will also strengthen Agilent’s footprint in Asian markets.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\nGrowth Prospects\nWe believe that the latest move will strengthen the company’s footing in the global neglected tropical diseases diagnosis market.\n\nPer an MMR research report, the global NTD diagnosis market size is expected to reach $8.97 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.5% between 2022 and 2029.\n\nA Grand View Research report predicts the global NTD diagnosis market size to witness a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2030.\n\nWe believe the company’s solid prospects in the promising NTD diagnosis market are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions.\n\nAgilent has lost 25.6% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s growth of 0.8%.\nLSAG Segment in Focus\nThe latest move is in sync with the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its LSAG segment.\n\nApart from the latest move, Agilent Technologies showcased its expanded InfinityLab GPC/SEC Solution at the HPLC Conference 2023 in Düsseldorf. The solution includes a dedicated column thermostat, multi-angle light scattering detector, GPC/SEC-Ready Kit, and WinGPC Software for advanced material characterization.\n\nAdditionally, Agilent's 1260 Infinity II Hybrid Multisampler, 1290 Infinity II Bio Online Sample Manager and Revident Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS System were also displayed at the HPLC 2023 conference.\n\nFurther, Agilent Technologies introduced new liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems, Agilent 6495D LC/TQ and Revident LC/Q-TOF, along with new software for profiling and library management, ensuring high analytical sensitivity and efficiency for fast, high-quality data and early maintenance feedback for optimal performance.\n\nAlso, Agilent launched the Agilent 8697 Headspace Sampler -XL Tray, offering 120 vial capacity and enhanced instrument intelligence features for increased uptime and operator ease of use compared to its predecessor.\n\nAll these endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the LSAG segment in the days ahead.\n\nHowever, the sluggish pharma market continues to remain a concern.\n\nOur model estimate for LSAG revenues for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $3.85 billion, indicating a decline of 3.9% from the fiscal 2022 level.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Asure Software ASUR, Applied Materials AMAT and Arista Networks ANET.

         "Q4 Stock Predictions: 3 S&P 500 Stocks Ready to Soar",
         "A",
         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nStocks ended the third quarter on a sour note. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive posture against inflation combined with soaring interest rates have investors taking defensive measures.\nBut it’s not time to give up on the stock market. In fact, thanks to the recent selling, bargains are springing up across many S&P 500 stocks.\nLet’s examine three that will benefit from current market conditions and rally heading into 2024.\nWells Fargo (WFC)\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the big banks that is thriving amid the industry’s correction. That’s because Wells Fargo did not aggressively expand its balance sheet or buy overvalued securities over the past few years.\nTrue, investors have shunned nearly all financials stocks this year amid unprecedented volatility in the interest rate markets. Banks that were positioned poorly, like First Republic and Silicon Valley, ended up going bust. And others are suffering from falling profitability and strained balance sheets at the present time.\nMeanwhile, Wells Fargo has positioned its balance sheet to earn far more profits as interest rates rise. And those rates are normally beneficial to the banking sector as a whole. For firms like Wells Fargo that managed their risks and exposures properly, that remains true in 2023.\nSpecifically, Wells Fargo’s net interest margin (NIM), the spread between its loan interest and deposit payments, has soared from 2.2% in Q2 of last year to 3.1% today. With a near 50% jump in core profitability on its loan book, it’s no wonder that Wells Fargo is reporting rising earnings. WFC stock hasn’t yet snapped out of the industrywide doldrums. As a result, shares go for just eight times forward earnings today.\nCharles River Laboratories (CRL)\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\nCharles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) is a leading healthcare company focused on providing lab tools and services related to pharmaceutical drug development.\nHistorically, it’s been the dominant player in animal models. Specifically, Charles River procures, breeds, and distributes lab rats, mice, rabbits, and non-human primates. The last one got Charles River in trouble, as the company was implicated in an investigation into alleged macaque smuggling in Cambodia. However, as of last quarter, Charles River has been able to resolve its sourcing issues around non-human primates.\nMore broadly, CRL stock has slumped amid the slowdown in the biotech industry. With smaller biotech companies struggling to obtain funding, Charles River is experiencing less trials and revenue-generating business. Yet, it’s only a matter of time until biotech funding rises again, given the priority to find cures for rare diseases.\nCRL will inevitably be part of those future cures. In fact, the company was involved in developing more than 80% of all drugs that received FDA approval since 2020. In effect, Charles River is a tax on the entire biotech industry, with their consistent postings of compounded earnings per share growth rate in the teens since the turn of the century.\nThanks to the recent scandal and biotech industry’s slump, CRL shares are now on sale at an unusually low 18 times forward earnings.\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS)\nSource: Funtap / Shutterstock.com\nKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) is a company that provides testing, product quality, and design solutions to technology companies. The firm has an interesting history.\nKeysight sprung up originally as Hewlett-Packard‘s Test & Measurement division more than half a century ago, and was ultimately spun off from Agilent (NYSE:A) into its own publicly-traded entity in 2014.\nKEYS stock has been incredibly successful over the past decade. Since 2014, shares jumped from $30 to a peak of more than $200. However, Keysight has fallen amid a slowdown in telecom and information technology spending over the past year. That  has led KEYS stock to slide back to around $130 today.\nThe weakness makes sense, as Keysight is heavily involved in quality control and testing for telecom companies. With 5G rollouts seeing an underwhelming debut as compared to expectations, that has cast a shadow on industry vendors. Other Keysight segments such as services for edge computing and RFID functions have slipped as demand levels off following an unusually robust 2021 and 2022.\nIndeed, the market is blowing the situation way out of proportion. KEYS stock is down to 16 times forward earnings, which is quite the discount for a tech company that has reliably posted double-digit earnings growth. It’s only a matter of time until telecom spending picks back up given the ever-growing demand for mobile data.\nAlso, Keysight is active in emerging growth fields such as AI and next-generation semiconductors. Investors should take advantage of the current dip in KEYS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in KEYS, CRL, and WFC stock.

         "Agilent (A) Down 6.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?",
         "A",
         "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Agilent Technologies (A). Shares have lost about 6.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Agilent due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nAgilent Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates\nAgilent Technologies delivered third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $1.43 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. The bottom line increased by 7% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.\n\nRevenues of $1.67 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 billion. However, the top line was down 2.7% on a reported basis and 2.3% on a core basis from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s levels.\n\nThe decline was attributed to sluggishness in Chemistry & Advanced Materials and Pharma & Biopharma markets due to weak momentum in China.\n\nNevertheless, growth in Academia & Gov’t, Food, Environmental & Forensics and Diagnostics and Clinical markets remained a positive.\nSegmental Top Line Details\nAgilent has three reporting segments, namely, Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG), Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG).\n\nLSAG: The segment accounted for $927 million or 55% of its total revenues, down 9% on a reported as well as on a core basis from the respective prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. This was due to macroeconomic uncertainties, soft market conditions in China and a sluggish pharma market. The reported figure came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $929 million.\n\nACG: Revenues from the segment were $396 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues. The figure surpassed the consensus mark of $377 million. The top line improved by 10% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading on a reported basis and by 11% on a core basis, demonstrating solid momentum across all regions and end markets. A strong demand for the company’s services was a positive.\n\nDGG: Revenues increased 3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported as well as a core basis to $349 million, accounting for the remaining 21% of total revenues. The figure came slightly below the consensus mark of $3508 million. Segmental growth was attributed to strength in the NASD business. A solid demand for diagnostic tests contributed well to the company’s pathology business.\n\nHowever, weakness in genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses was a negative.\nOperating Results\nFor the fiscal third quarter, gross margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 50 basis points (bps) to 29.9% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. ACG’s gross margin expanded by 390 bps to 50.9%. DGG’s gross margin contracted by 180 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to 52.2%.\n\nResearch & development (R&D) costs were $118 million, up 1.7% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $407 million, down 1.2% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s figure. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses expanded by 35 bps year over year to 7.05%. SG&A expenses expanded by 40 bps year over year to 24.3%.\n\nOperating margin for the fiscal third quarter was 7.9%, which declined significantly from 23.9% in the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s figure.\n\nSegment-wise, the operating margin for LSAG was down 60 bps from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s level of 29.9%. ACG’s operating margin was 32.7%, up 810 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. DGG segment’s operating margin expanded 250 bps to 24% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s figure.\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\nAs of Jul 31, 2023, Agilent’s cash and cash equivalents were $1.33 billion, up from $1.18 billion on Apr 30, 2023.\n\nAccounts receivables were $1.3 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023, down from $1.4 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023.\n\nLong-term debt was $2.734 billion for the reported quarter compared with $2.733 billion in the prior fiscal quarter.\n\nAgilent generated $562 million in cash from operations during the reported quarter, up from $398 million generated in the previous quarter.\n\nIt returned $401 million to shareholders, out of which dividend payments accounted for $66 million and share repurchases accounted for the remaining $335 million.\nGuidance\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, management expects revenues of $1.655-$1.705 billion, suggesting a decline between 12.2% and 9.5% on a core basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $1.33-$1.36.\n\nFor fiscal 2023, management lowered its revenue guidance to the band of $6.80-$6.85 billion from $6.93-7.03 billion, implying growth of 0.8-1.5% on a core basis from the respective fiscal 2022 figures.\n\nManagement also lowered the guidance for fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share downward from $5.60-$5.65 to $5.40-5.43.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -16.1% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nAt this time, Agilent has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Agilent has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.\n4 Oil Stocks with Massive Upsides\nGlobal demand for oil is through the roof... and oil producers are struggling to keep up.

         "Do Options Traders Know Something About Agilent (A) Stock We Don't?",
         "A",
         "Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. A need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Agilent shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Agilent is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Electronics - Testing Equipment industry that ranks in the Bottom 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.61 per share to $1.35 in that period.\nGiven the way analysts feel about Agilent right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\nLooking to Trade Options?\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.\nClick to see the trades now >>\nZacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

This is a timely investment that you can catch while it emerges from its bear market lows.\nIt could rival or surpass other recent Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

         "Building Wealth with Spinoffs: How Adding These Gems Can Transform Your Portfolio",
         "A",
         "Imagine discovering a treasure map that leads to the chest containing the loot. Consider that the investment world has its own version of these concealed treasures: Spinoffs. These financial treasures have the potential to reshape your entire investment voyage, not just enhance your portfolio. The catch? You must look for them and do some work. A tough ask, I know.\nWhat is A Spinoff?\nIn a Spinoff, a parent company separates one of its business entities or divisions into a standalone, independent company. By distributing shares of the spun-off company to the current proprietors of the parent, two separate publicly listed entities are created. The new enterprise that emerges because of a Spinoff is often referred to as a \"Spinoff company.\" Spinoffs can increase shareholder value by allowing distinct companies to focus on their core competencies and releasing hidden value in specific business divisions. In addition, it offers investors the option to invest in various companies based on their investment preferences and risk tolerance. Or, alternatively, eradicate them.\nThe media frequently gets it wrong when speaking about Spinoffs. This is a very important point to remember. A ‘true’ Spinoff only happens when a share of a division is distributed amongst existing shareholders that own the parent company. Contrary to the media, IPOs, Divestitures, carve-outs, split-offs, and split-ups are not Spinoffs and consequently, these transactions lose many of the value creating dynamics of the Spinoff corporate action. Cross-reference information from various trustworthy sources, particularly official business communication. To fully comprehend the Spinoff and its ramifications, investors should also look for information from reliable financial analysts, subject-matter experts, and formal regulatory filings, such as those with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nDo Spinoffs Outperform? \nThe “Spinoff” is an essentially inefficient method for distributing stock to the incorrect individuals. You receive shares whether you desire them or not. Typically, investors acquire these shares by default and sell them on the open market almost immediately, making them inexpensive companies that no one is interested in. They are occasionally referred to as \"orphan securities.\" At this point, X marks the location, and digging should commence.\nWhy the dynamics of Spinoffs make it an essential area for an investor to analyze:\nStudies have shown that Spinoffs have historically beaten the market by over 10 percent as the pure, newly focused business takes off.\nCompensation for executives can be more closely correlated with business performance. The company will become smaller, which will increase the executives' motivation and sense of ownership.\nSeparating companies allows each entity to be properly valued and can sometimes unlock a “conglomerate discount.\"\nDue to the likelihood that the company would be small and lack a roadshow, it is under-followed. As a result, there are more chances for investors to discover returns greater than the index.\nThe Edge Consulting Groups 20 year study shows that Spinoffs are likely to be taken over. Roughly 35 percent are acquired around the two-year mark post-Spinoff.\nTypically, there are hundreds of Spinoff situations a year. Around 40 have over $1 billion in market cap. This is a sweet spot where liquidity and “real” companies come together in my opinion.\n5 Reasons Why You Should Be Looking For These Situations \nIncluding Spinoffs in your investment portfolio can provide a variety of benefits, including diversification, undervalued opportunities, and the potential for higher returns and enhanced performance.\n1. Enhanced Diversification: Incorporating Spinoffs introduces a new layer of diversification. Since Spinoff companies often operate in different sectors than their parent companies, they can provide exposure to industries that might not have been represented in your portfolio. This helps spread risk and reduces the impact of negative events within a specific sector.\n2. Undervalued Opportunities: Spinoffs are sometimes overlooked by the market, leading to potential undervaluation. This presents an opportunity for investors to purchase shares of promising companies at a lower price compared to their intrinsic value. As the market gradually recognizes their worth, these undervalued gems can yield substantial returns.\n3. Focused Management: Spinoff companies can streamline operations and focus on their core competencies, which often leads to improved efficiency and performance. The management teams of these newly independent entities tend to be more agile and dedicated to the success of their specific business, potentially translating into better growth prospects.\n4. Catalyst for Change: The newfound independence of a Spinoff can lead to strategic changes, such as cost-cutting initiatives, innovation, and targeted expansion plans. These changes can drive improved financial performance and boost shareholder value over time.\n5. Potential for Outperformance: Historical data indicates that Spinoffs often outperform the broader market indices. This outperformance can be attributed to a combination of factors, including improved focus, better capital allocation decisions, and the market's eventual recognition of the Spinoff's value proposition.\nWhy isn’t Everybody Looking At Them?\nI asked the legendary investor Joel Greenblatt this question once and he didn’t hesitate to give me the answer. ‘No one wants to do the work.’ Spinoffs analysis takes a lot of effort and, surprise, surprise, not many want to do it. However, as an investment veteran of over 30 years, I can categorically say that some of my most profitable ideas come from doing a hell of a lot of work and finding the angle and edge in the situation in this area. Furthermore, they are not promoted by brokers. Unlike an IPO there is no stock to sell you. You gain the Spinoff from holding the parent company whether you like it or not. This opens a whole range of dynamics that are interesting for investing. \nRecent Spinoffs That You May Know\nAbbVie (ABBV)  (formerly known as Abbott Laboratories' biopharmaceutical business) was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. AbbVie has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 200% since the spinoff.\nVisa (V) was spun off from Bank of America (BAC) in 2008. Visa has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 400% since Spinoff.\nMastercard (MA) was spun off from American Express (AXP) in 2006. Mastercard has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 300% since Spinoff.\nAgilent Technologies (A)  was spun off from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)  in 1999. Agilent Technologies has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 200% since the spinoff.\nJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ)  Life Sciences division was spun off as a separate company called Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies in 2017. Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 50% since the spinoff.\nThese are just a few examples of successful stock Spinoffs. There are many other examples, and the success of a spinoff can vary depending on several factors, such as the underlying business, the management team, and the market condition.\nIn Summary \nIf you are after hidden value where no one else is looking, look no further than this area of the market. There are services out there that can help, but ultimately a little hard work in a proven area will get you to some positive wealth creation a lot faster than competing with the masses.\nOn the date of publication, Jim Osman did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

         "By David Carnevali\nNEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Danaher Corp DHR.N is in the lead to acquire Abcam Plc ABCM.O, a provider of supplies to life science researchers with a market value of $5.4 billion, as it expands its biomedical offerings, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\nAbcam believes that Danaher's all-cash offer is superior to a rival bid from Agilent Technologies Inc A.N, the sources said.\nThe exact price that Danaher is offering could not be learned. One of the sources said the deal price would be close to Abcam's current valuation, given that its stock has already risen more than 20% after Bloomberg News reported on June 16 that the company was fielding takeover interest.\nIf the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that no agreement is certain and that the outcome could still change.

The company serves roughly 750,000 research scientists at academic, research, government and biopharmaceutical organizations.\nAbcam has come under pressure from activist shareholders to sell itself, including its founder Jonathan Milner who owns 6.1% of the company, as well as hedge fund Starboard Value LP, complaining about the company's stock underperforming for most of the last two years.\nDanaher, one of the world's largest suppliers of diagnostic tools with a market value of $190 billion, has turned to dealmaking to expand in the sector. Abcam's antibody and reagent solutions could help Danaher win more and bigger contracts with some customers.\nDanaher acquired General Electric Co's GE.N biopharma solution business for $21.4 billion in 2019 and contract development and manufacturing organization Aldevron for $9.6 billion in 2021.\n(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Nick Zieminski)\n((Greg.Roumeliotis@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6022; Reuters Messaging: greg.roumeliotis.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

         "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nAugust has been a great month for investors looking for bargain stocks to buy on the dip. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq 100 were down 2,1%, 2.0%, and 2.4%, respectively, for the week of Aug. 14-18. Barron’s believes that September could be worse. If the past week is any indication, they could be on to something. \nFundstrat analyst Tom Lee thinks August has been its typical mercurial self where gains are hard to come by and that the good times should return soon. Baron’s reported Lee’s comments from his Aug. 18 note to clients:\n“[T]he month’s declines haven’t shaken Lee’s core bullish thesis. ‘We see this more as ‘it’s August’ rather than the start of a larger rout…we are not in the camp this spills over into a wider selloff. That could happen, but more bad things need to emerge. In fact, there are some signs that we could see the stocks begin to stabilize soon.’”\nSo, if you’re a risk-averse investor, you might want to wait a couple of weeks to see if the markets bottom. \nIn the meantime, a quick screen of S&P 500 stocks down more than 20% over the past month gives bargain-hunting investors 14 stocks to choose from. Here are three undervalued due to their 20%, including one name from three different sectors. \nSealed Air (SEE)\nSource: Shutterstock\nSealed Air (NYSE:SEE) represents the materials sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 31% year-to-date. \nAnalysts are moderately optimistic about the stock, with 7 of the 15 rating it as Overweight or an outright Buy. It’s target price is $45 which is 31% higher than its current share price. \nOne of the things that I use to assess value is free cash flow yield. If it’s over 8%, it’s definitely value. Between 4% and 8%, it’s reasonable value, if not dirt cheap. In the trailing 12 months ended June 30, its free cash flow was $152 million. Based on an enterprise value of $9.78 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 1.6%, which suggests it’s not cheap.\nBefore you toss the company best known for bubble wrap packaging overboard, consider its historical FCF yield. In 2020, it had a free cash flow of $556 million. Based on an enterprise value of $10.6 billion. At first glance, it appears Sealed Air’s business has deteriorated. \nAnd to a certain extent, it has, which is why it’s moving forwqard with SEE 2.0. This revitalization plan should deliver $150 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2025 and a return to its historical earnings and sales growth in 2024. \nIts stock hasn’t been this low since June 2020. Get ready for a revival in the waning months of 2023 and into 2024.\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS)\nSource: fantasyform/Shutterstock.com\nKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) represents the tech sector. Its stock is down 23% for the past month and 24% year-to-date. Like Sealed Air, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.\nKeysight is a relatively new company by S&P 500 standards, incorporated in 2013. However, its history dates back to 1939 and Hewlett-Packard’s founding by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. Their first product was an audio oscillator. Electronic measurement was their business.\nIn 1999, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) was formed to operate HP’s Medical Products and Instrument Group. In 2013, Agilent was split into two pure-play electronic measurement companies. Keysight was the one of the two, going public on November 1, 2014 after separating from Agilent. Agilent shareholders got one share of Keysight for two held by the parent. \nKEYS stock is up 335% since it began trading in November 2014. Agilent is up 191% over the same period.\nShares have lost their mojo recently because the company reported Q3 2023 results on August 18th that included a downward revision of its guidance. It now expects fourth-quarter sales and earnings to decline by 10% and 13%, respectively. \nCurrently trading at 4.16x sales — less than its five-year average of 5.1x — its enterprise value of $22.5 billion is 12.87x its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That’s lower than it’s been since 2016.\nResMed (RMD)\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\nResMed (NYSE:RMD) represents the healthcare sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 21% year-to-date. Like the other two, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.\nInterestingly, ResMed’s business is probably doing the best in terms of top-line growth among the trio, up 23% in Q4 2023 and 18% for all of 2023 to $4.2 billion. However, investors began to abandon the stock after hearing its gross margin (56.5%) and operating margin (29.0%) dropped for the year.    \nAll of its stock losses in 2023 are post-earnings. Investors have rightly or wrongly decided that the contraction of its margins in light of double-digit revenue growth suggests the quality of the sales increase for the maker of sleep apnea equipment is suspect. \nResMed CEO Mick Farrell is very confident about the future. He stated in the Q4 2023 conference call:\n“Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients.”\nOf the 24 analysts covering the stock, 18 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy with a $240 median price, 45% higher than its current share price. \nI see ResMed as the best long-term hold of the trio, although all three should make you money over 3-5 years.    \nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
